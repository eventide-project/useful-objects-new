# A bare /slasher offers topics to learn about

Source: system/foundation/source/a-bare-slasher-offers-topics-to-learn-about.md

Trigger: When the engineer types a bare `/slasher`, with nothing after it

1. A bare `/slasher` offers topics to learn about, through the selection interface: *Items*, *Features*, *Experiments*, and *Commands*. The free-text option takes any other topic.
2. Explain a topic selected or typed briefly, as *Briefly explain <topic>* would. Lead with the point, and keep it short.
3. For *Commands*, print the command domain table word for word, and nothing else.
4. Offer no other topics.
5. Offer the topics once. Do not offer them again after the explanation or the table.

# A command domain carries its rows of the command table

Source: system/foundation/source/a-command-domain-carries-its-rows-of-the-command-table.md

Trigger: When writing or changing a Slasher command, its help, or a shortcut alias

**Trigger:** When writing or changing a Slasher command, its help, or a shortcut alias

**A command domain's rows live beside its skill, in `command-table-rows.md`.** A command domain is a group of root commands that share one heading, one description, and one help command in the Slasher help. Its row names the domain's help command, and its description is the one under that heading. A domain with no root command of its own name has a skill named for the domain, as `/process` for PROCESS and `/language` for LANGUAGE, and its rows live beside that skill. A package carries the rows of the domains it holds, as `imap` carries `/email`'s.

**One row to a domain, and a few root commands have rows of their own.** `/features` has a row below `/feature`, `/experiments` below `/experiment`, `/decision` below `/log`, and `/note` below `/decision`, each in its domain's rows file. `/clarify, /??`, `/idk`, `/ask-again, /aa`, `/estimate-confidence, /%`, `/unattended, /#`, `/shortcuts, /sc`, and `/load` have rows of their own, beside their skills, in that order at the bottom of the table. The PHASE domain has no row. Write no other root command, alias, or subcommand into a row.

**A description may open with *These commands*, as the help does.** No description opens with *This command*. Keep each row in line with the help: when a domain's heading, its help command, or its description changes in the help, change its row in the same commit.

**The table's top rows are foundation's.** `plugin/command-table-header.md` holds the heading and the rows that open the table: `/slasher help`, then each command with a shortcut alias. Their order is `/commands, /;`, `/recent, /.`, `/current, /'`, `/next, /proceed, /..`, and `/next?, /?`. A command of another package with a shortcut alias has its row beside its skill, as `/push, /p` in the `git` package.

**A row with a shortcut alias names the command first and the alias after it, as `/recent, /.`.** A command with an alias and a shortcut names the alias, then the shortcut last, as `/next, /proceed, /..`. This holds in the full table and in the startup table alike.

**The help's order is the table's order.** `plugin/help-order` lists the domains in the order the help and the table both follow. A domain it does not list follows, in name order. Add a new domain to it where its row belongs.

**A shortcut alias changes three files together.** Change its row in `command-table-header.md` or beside its skill, its row in `plugin/shortcuts.md`, and `plugin/command-table-startup.md` where it names the alias, in the same commit. `plugin/shortcuts.md` is foundation's, and lists another package's shortcut too, as `/p`.

**The startup table's four rows stand in `plugin/command-table-startup.md`.** The `/slasher help` row also names `/help`. The `/commands, /;` row reads *Print the list of Slasher commands*. The `/recent, /.` row takes `/recent`'s description from the help. The `/current, /'` row reads *Lists the current items, features, and experiments.* The plugin build writes the sentence below them, naming every other command, so the sentence is never written by hand.

**Each table is followed by the help line:** *Type /help for all of Slasher's help, or /<command> help for one command's.* The plugin build adds it.

**Why:** a package that is not installed should add no row, and a row kept beside its command changes with it. The order and the wording stay consistent because one rule states them, read when a command is written, not at every session start.

**How to apply:** when you write or change a command, its help, or a shortcut alias, change its row in its domain's `command-table-rows.md`, or foundation's plugin files for the top rows and the shortcuts, and run `./compile.sh` so the plugin's tables are rebuilt.

# A command takes its subcommand first, asks when it has none, and its domain takes help

Source: system/foundation/source/a-command-takes-its-subcommand-first-asks-when-it-has-none-and-its-domain-takes-help.md

Trigger: When running or writing a Slasher slash command

1. A Slasher command is typed `/<command> [<subcommand>] [<arguments>]`. The first word after the name is the subcommand, and the rest are its arguments, as in `/item list current`. Every command reads its words this way.
2. With no subcommand, the command asks which one is meant, through the selection interface, unless its help gives the bare command a meaning of its own, as a bare `/journal` writes an entry.
3. Where a command has more than four subcommands, the question groups them, and asks again within the group selected.
4. An alias does exactly what the command it names does, as `/idea` does `/item idea`. Its arguments pass to that command unchanged.
5. Each command domain, a group of root commands under one heading in the Slasher help, has one help command, which prints the domain's part of the help text. It is the domain's own root command where it has one, as `/log help`, and otherwise a command that takes only `help`, as `/process help`.
6. Any other command in the domain takes no `help`. `/next help` says so, names `/process help`, and does nothing more.
7. A subcommand that is not the command's own is not guessed at. The command says so, and asks which one is meant, through the selection interface. Where the command's help gives it words of its own, as `/log <message>` does, a first word that is not a subcommand starts those words. `/log The cart keeps its contents for 30 days` writes that entry, and `/log summary` still summarizes.
8. A command's skill only reads the words typed, and hands the act to the rule that governs it. That rule says what the act is. This rule does not, and governs only how a command is typed and how its words are read.
9. `help` is always the subcommand, never an argument. `/reserve help` does not reserve the word "help".

# A date in a record's title is written as the day, the date, and the 24-hour time

Source: system/foundation/source/a-date-in-a-records-title-is-written-as-the-day-the-date-and-the-24-hour-time.md

Trigger: When writing a date into a working-state record's title

1. A working-state record's title may carry a date, as the work session record's `# Work Session — <name> (<date>)` does.
2. In any record whose title is dated, write the date in this form:

```
Mon Jan 1 2026 18:06
```

3. The order is day-of-week, month, day, year, then 24-hour hours and minutes.
4. Do not write `at`, AM/PM, or seconds.
5. Do not add a timezone abbreviation or any other timezone marker.
6. The time is the author's local time.
7. The date is the record's authoring time. It is the same instant as its ISO-8601-UTC filename prefix, rendered in local time.
8. For a record covering work over more than one day, the title still names the single moment the record was written.
9. Do not write a date range.
10. Render the date with the command `date "+%a %b %-d %Y %H:%M"`.
11. This title form is distinct from the other two record date formats. Each format is used only where it is specified.
12. The filename prefix stays machine-sortable UTC to the second, such as `2026-07-24T18-16-22Z-…`, per the file-names rule.
13. The provenance footer stays local time to the second with a zone abbreviation, such as `Fri Jul 24 2026 at 11:58:56 AM PT`, per the record-a-rules-authorship-in-a-provenance-footer rule.
14. The title is the one exception to the a-time-value-carries-minutes-and-seconds rule. Every other datetime written into a file carries seconds.
15. The exception is narrow and covers only the title's date.

# A design section documenting a package dependency is titled "Package Dependency"

Source: system/foundation/source/a-design-section-documenting-a-package-dependency-is-titled-package-dependency.md

Trigger: When writing a section of a [design] item that documents a dependency on a package

1. A design is an item tagged `[design]`.
2. A design may have a section documenting a dependency on a package.
3. A package means a gem, a library, or another installable package.
4. Title that section **Package Dependency**.
5. Do not title it just "Dependency".
6. Use plain "Dependency" only for sections about something other than a package.

# A log entry is written for an implementation record, and the concluding entry depends on whether the work merged

Source: system/foundation/source/a-log-entry-is-written-for-an-implementation-record-and-the-concluding-entry-depends-on-whether-the-work-merged.md

Trigger: When creating an implementation record, or changing its **State:** line

## An implementation record takes a log entry

1. An implementation record pairs with a one-line entry in `slasher/local/logs/log/`.
2. Write the entry when the record is created.
3. Write another entry on each change of the canonical `**State:**` line.

## The concluding entry depends on whether the work reached `master`

1. The concluding entry takes one of two forms. Which one is not a matter of taste.
2. The form is decided by whether the work merged.
3. Merged work means affirmed work merged into its upstream branch, or completed work integrated, whatever the kind.
4. For merged work, the entry is a summary marker. It names the record and its state, and stops there.
5. Unmerged work means refuted, inconclusive, abandoned, or superseded work, whatever the kind. That work is never merged, and its branch is deleted only on confirmation. Its record is kept, marked with its state, as evidence.
6. For unmerged work, the entry states the question or the intent, and the verdict or the outcome. It carries the finding, and only where there is one.
7. For unmerged work that reached a verdict, the entry states the question or the intent, the verdict, and what was found.
8. For abandoned work, the entry states the intent, that it was abandoned, and the reasoning given for stopping.
9. An abandoned-work entry does not reproduce the plan, the increments, or the design the work produced. A careful tense is not enough (see the the-log-records-why-work-was-abandoned-and-never-says-undone-work-was-done rule).
10. The entry carries the substance whenever the branch did not merge, whether or not the record reached `master` by another route.
11. Do not rely on the practice of committing the record to `master` while the work is on a branch.
12. Write the findings, and for abandoned work the reasoning given for stopping, into the entry, so that `master` holds them without the record.

## What is already required, and not restated

1. Affirmed work still copies its own log into the project's log, as an-implementation-runs-on-a-branch-to-a-declared-end rule requires.
2. The summary marker sits beside those copied entries. It does not replace them.
3. Work without a verdict has no affirmation and no log copy. Completed work's marker is the whole of what its conclusion writes.

## What is not logged

1. Write no log entry for a confirmation the lifecycle records.
2. Those confirmations are the working-location selection, the attended-or-unattended selection, a worktree added mid-flight, and branch deletion. They are recorded in the record.
3. Write no log entry for a turn of the work.
4. The hinges, the cycles, and the runs belong to the loop record and the implementation record.

# A log entry is written for an item on creation, on each settled resolution, and on a change of state

Source: system/foundation/source/a-log-entry-is-written-for-an-item-on-creation-on-each-settled-resolution-and-on-a-change-of-state.md

Trigger: When creating an item, adding a dated Settled resolution to it, changing its **State:** line

1. An item in `slasher/local/items/` pairs with a one-line entry in `slasher/local/logs/log/`.
2. Write the entry at three moments, and at no others.
3. The item's kind tag, such as `[design]`, `[plan]`, or `[aspiration]`, makes no difference, and an item with no kind tag takes the same entries.
4. Write the entry on the item's creation.
5. Write the entry on each dated `Settled` resolution added after the item is created.
6. Write the entry on each change of the item's `**State:**` line.
7. A change of state is the line reaching any state word the items rule names: Open, Active, a concluding state such as Realized, Done, Corrected, Resolved, or Completed, or Deferred, Suspended, Discontinued, Superseded, Abandoned, or Obsolete.
8. A change of state is also the line taking a state back, by resume.
9. A design and a note are `Recorded` and never move, so each takes a creation entry only.
10. Do not log a completed checkbox task, because it carries out a direction already settled.
11. Do not log prose that settles nothing either. Examples are reconciling a Background & Motivation section, correcting a summary, and rewording a section.
12. The provenance footer records those unlogged changes.
13. The entry names the record and what happened to it: the record was written, or its state reached a word.
14. What the record settles may follow, attributed to the record.
15. Never state an unbuilt direction in the indicative mood.
16. *The check runs at the engineer's first prompt* says the system does that. While the item is `Open` or `Active`, it does not.
17. The `git` package's commit-message rules ask for the changed thing in its new state. That form is right for a change to the software.
18. An item is not a change to the software, so do not use that form for it.
19. The fact about an item is that it was recorded, or that its state moved.
20. Carry the same into the commit subject the entry travels in: name the record, attribute what it settles to the record, and keep the mood. An entry corrected while its commit subject makes the same claim is half corrected.
21. Fix no wording template. *X is recorded as an item, Open because …* and *X is realized* are forms in use.
22. This rule states the obligation once, for every item.
23. The a-note-is-a-remark-worth-keeping-whose-one-state-recorded-never-changes rule, the a-projects-binding-rules-are-recorded-in-its-packages-and-its-local-rules-directory rule, and the a-suspension-is-a-log-entry-tagged-suspended-and-nothing-is-moved rule state their own entries.
24. The the-items-directory-holds-one-file-per-item rule points here and keeps no second copy.
25. The the-log-holds-one-file-per-entry-with-a-one-line-title rule's general trigger is to log whenever a real decision is made, and when in doubt. It rests on each writer's judgment, so it does not make the entries reliable.

# A log entry recording an engineer's decision is tagged `[decision]`

Source: system/foundation/source/a-log-entry-recording-an-engineers-decision-is-tagged-decision.md

Trigger: When writing a log entry that records a decision, or when the engineer types `/decision`

1. When the engineer makes a decision, the log entry that records it carries `**Tags:** [decision]`.
2. The tag says who decided. Every log entry states a decision, so the tag marks the engineer's.
3. An entry tagged `[decision]` records a choice the engineer made. Examples are a direction set, a question settled, and work held for a later piece of work.
4. The engineer's decision is the engineer's own choice. It may be stated in the engineer's words.
5. It may also be made by choosing among options the agent puts forward.
6. An act the agent takes under a rule is not an engineer's decision, even when the engineer approved it.
7. Do not tag an entry for an act the agent took under a rule. Do not tag such an entry `[decision]`.

## The tag

1. The entry carries the tag under its title, separated by a blank line.
2. The tag uses the one form every record uses:

```
# The README item settles that the README's content is addressed with Slasher's website, and waits for it

**Tags:** [decision]
```

3. An entry may carry other tags beside this one.
4. An engineer's decision to stop doing something is tagged `[decision] [suspended]`.
5. What `[decision]` marks is fixed here.
6. The set of the engineer's decisions is read from this tag.

## The /decision command

1. `/decision <text>` logs the text as the engineer's decision. The text is the entry's title, in the engineer's words, with grammar and flow corrected and nothing added.
2. The entry carries `**Tags:** [decision]` and follows every convention of the log, per the the-log-holds-one-file-per-entry-with-a-one-line-title rule.
3. `/decision` alone logs the decision the conversation has just reached, stated as the title, as a bare `/log` states the work's, tagged `[decision]`.
4. Where that decision is the agent's act under a rule, say so and write nothing.
5. Where it is unclear which decision is meant, ask, through the selection interface. Where nothing has been decided, say so and write nothing.
6. Commit the entry with the change it bears on, or on its own with a `Log:` prefix.

# A note is a remark worth keeping, whose one state, Recorded, never changes

Source: system/foundation/source/a-note-is-a-remark-worth-keeping-whose-one-state-recorded-never-changes.md

Trigger: When recording or revising a note in slasher/local/items/

Lines 1–8 below are the opening statements, which come before any section heading.

1. A note is a remark worth keeping that binds nothing.
2. It can be a working hypothesis, a definition, an unratified method, a finding, or any other remark that should not be lost.
3. It is not read as binding at session start, the way rules are. It records what was thought or seen when it was written.
4. A note lives in `slasher/local/items/`.
5. A note is tagged `[note]`.
6. The tag is what makes a record a note.
7. The word *observation* belongs to Design By Efferent, where it is what a test reads about the outcome of an actuation.
8. Never call a remark worth keeping an observation. It is a note.

## `Recorded` is a note's only state, and it never changes

1. A note carries `**State:** Recorded` from the moment it is written.
2. It keeps that state for the rest of its life.
3. Its filename ends `-RECORDED`.
4. It carries no `**Why this state:**` line.
5. A note has no lifecycle.
6. It is never realized, abandoned, obsolete, superseded, or suspended.
7. A note that no longer holds is not retracted.
8. A later note states the later thinking.
9. The earlier note stays as what was thought at the time.
10. A note is not promoted.
11. Where the thinking stabilizes into a binding convention, write the rule in `slasher/local/rules/` the way any rule is written.
12. Do not change the note. It takes no line naming the rule.
13. The the-items-directory-holds-one-file-per-item rule needs no exception, because a note also carries a state from the moment it is written. Its state is fixed, not absent.

## The shape

1. **When to use:** use a note for material worth keeping that binds nothing: a hypothesis under discovery, an unratified method or definition, a finding, or a remark.
2. When in doubt between a rule and a note, prefer a note.
3. **Format:** use the same frontmatter-free markdown as rules.
4. The file starts with a `# <title>`, then a `**State:** Recorded` line.
5. Next comes a `**Tags:**` line carrying `[note]`, then the content in prose.
6. The filename follows the ISO-8601-UTC prefix convention (see the file-names rule).
7. The filename ends `-RECORDED`.
8. **Provenance footer:** end the file with the `Authored by … / Changed by …` footer, like every working-state artifact.
9. **Recording one:** add the file.
10. Add a matching one-line entry to `slasher/local/logs/log/`, noting it was recorded as a note.
11. Never change a note's state.
12. Where the thinking moves, write a later note and leave the earlier one as written.

# When an implementation's phase starts, its goal is stated, and the phases are listed with the current one marked

Source: system/foundation/source/a-phase-starts-by-stating-its-goal.md

Trigger: When starting a phase of an experiment or a feature, or when the engineer asks for the current phase or the list of phases, as with `/experiment status` or `/feature status`

1. At the start of an experiment's or a feature's phase, state the phase's goal to the engineer, before its work, in the response that starts it.
2. The goal is the phase's question or intent, whichever it has, whatever the kind. For a question, it is what the phase is to establish. For an intent, it is what the phase is to build. Say how it serves the implementation's question or intent.
3. List the implementation's phases with it, in the order the record names them, and mark the current phase, so the engineer sees which phases are done and which are still to come.
4. State the goal and the list at each phase's start, not only when the record is written. The record's naming of the phases, and a phase's forecast, do not stand in for them.
5. When the engineer asks for the current phase, as with `/phase` or `/phase current`, print its goal and its branch.
6. When the engineer asks for the phases, as with `/phases`, list them in the record's order, with the current phase emphasized.
7. `/experiment status` and `/feature status` print the phases in the record's order, the current one emphasized, and the current phase's goal. Without phases, they print the implementation's question or intent, and its state.

# A printed list of records is formatted as a table or as a list of rows

Source: system/foundation/source/a-printed-list-of-records-is-formatted-as-a-table-or-as-a-list-of-rows.md

Trigger: When the engineer asks for a list of records, as with `/item list`, `/list`, `/items`, `/current`, `/features`, or `/experiments`

1. When the engineer asks for a list of records, render it as a table where every field is short, and as rows where a field runs to a sentence. A table presents the fields in headed columns. Rows present one record to a line, with its fields in sequence and no columns. A list is called a table only where it is formatted as columns.
2. This applies to any record type. That includes items, implementation records, log entries, loop records, work session records, migration records, journal entries, and commits.
3. The first column is the record's handle and has no heading.
4. The handle is the ISO-8601-UTC filename prefix for a working-state artifact, or the short SHA for a commit.
5. Every column after the handle has a heading.
6. Two SHA columns come right after the handle: the commit that created the record, then the last commit to touch it. A list of items takes no SHA columns, and opens with an ordinal ahead of the handle, which the engineer refers to a row by. The ordinal counts from 1, in the order the rows are printed.
7. These two SHA columns are always present, in every list but a list of items, a list of commits, or the lists `/features` and `/experiments` print. They are not chosen per request.
8. After the SHA columns comes the title. Then comes one column for the fact asked about.

```
|                        | created   | changed   | implementation                   | state     |
|------------------------|-----------|-----------|----------------------------------|-----------|
| `2026-08-25T00-36-18Z` | `159985b` | `ed7ec4a` | Feature — Self-Explanation       | Abandoned |
| `2026-10-21T05-44-56Z` | `d27a638` | `66d2ea2` | Feature — "Item" replaces "idea" | Completed |
```

A list of items takes the ordinal and no SHA columns:

```
| # |                        | item                        | state  |
|---|------------------------|-----------------------------|--------|
| 1 | `2026-08-10T20-54-51Z` | A Generalized Description   | Active |
| 2 | `2026-08-23T06-58-41Z` | Slasher for content and web | Open   |
```

9. A record that was never amended shows the same SHA in both columns. This is intended, since it shows the record has not been touched since it was written.
10. Choose the last column to fit the question.
11. A list of items or implementations takes the state as its last column.
12. A list of commits asked about for their subject widths takes the width.
13. Do not add a column nobody asked for.
14. A list of commits takes no SHA columns.

## Listing items by state

1. A list of items may be asked for by state, and lists the items whose `**State:**` line reads that state.
2. `current` asks for the Open and Active items together. It is not a state, and it leaves out Suspended items.

## The current command

1. `/current` lists the current items, then, under a heading of their own, the current implementations.
2. The current implementations are the features and experiments whose `**State:**` line reads Open, Active, or Suspended.
3. Present each current implementation as one row: its handle, its title, and its state. The title is the record's own, as in `Feature — The current command`. Give it no ordinal and no SHA columns.
4. Where no implementation is current, print the one line *No current feature or experiment.* under the summary's heading, in place of the rows.
5. In the items table `/current` prints, put a kind column between the title and the state. It names the kind each tag gives as a word, not a tag: *Idea* for `[idea]`, *Legal matter* for `[legal-matter]`. Several tags are named each, separated by commas. Other lists of items take no kind column unless it is asked for.
6. `/current` takes an optional number *n*, as in `/current 5`. It then lists only the *n* most recently created current items, by handle, oldest first, with ordinals from 1. It lists the current implementations in full.
7. Below the items table, under the heading *Other items*, print the count of each state other than Open and Active that some item holds, as one comma-separated sentence: `47 Realized, 18 Recorded, 12 Abandoned`. Order the states from the largest count to the smallest. Count Suspended items here too.
8. A number given to `/current` does not change these counts.

## The features and experiments commands

1. `/features` lists the current features, and `/experiments` lists the current experiments: those whose `**State:**` line reads Open, Active, or Suspended.
2. A record's kind is the word its title opens with, as in `Feature — The current command`.
3. Present each record as one row: an ordinal, its handle, its title, and its state. Give it no SHA columns.
4. Each command takes an optional number *n*, as in `/features 3`. It then lists only the *n* most recently created current records of its kind, by handle, oldest first, with ordinals from 1.
5. Each command takes `current` too, as `/items` does. `/features current` does what `/features` does, and `/features current 3` what `/features 3` does.
6. Where none of its kind is current, print the one line *No current feature.* or *No current experiment.* in place of the rows.
7. Below the list, under the heading *Other features* or *Other experiments*, print the count of each state other than Open, Active, and Suspended that some record of the kind holds, as one comma-separated sentence: `34 Completed, 1 Abandoned`. Order the states from the largest count to the smallest.
8. A number given to the command does not change these counts.

## Keep every column short

1. Keep every column short.
2. Do not put a field that runs to a sentence in a table. Present rows instead, unless the engineer asks for a table, which is then rendered in rows and columns.
3. Where a record's summary is wanted, present rows instead of a table. This is part of the rule, not a failure of it.

## What this does not reach

1. This rule does not reach the status report's tables. They stay tables, under the a-status-report-prints-a-fixed-whole-project-report rule.
2. This rule does not govern an answer that is not a list of records.
3. The `language` package's an-answer-is-a-list-and-prose-must-justify-itself rule governs the form of an answer's list items. This rule governs only how a set of records is presented.

# A record carrying a state line ends its filename with the state in upper case

Source: system/foundation/source/a-record-carrying-a-state-line-ends-its-filename-with-the-state-in-upper-case.md

Trigger: When creating, renaming, changing the state of, or referencing an item or implementation record

1. Where a record carries a canonical `**State:**` line, its filename ends with that state word in upper case.
2. The state word is appended to the name with a dash, before the extension.

```
2026-07-27T07-09-02Z-the-feature-capability-REALIZED.md
2026-08-05T19-37-06Z-ooda-terminology-REFUTED.md
2026-08-06T04-32-50Z-ooda-mode-COMPLETED.md
```

3. This reaches every record that carries a state line: an implementation record, whether experiment or feature, and an item.
4. Each convention fixes its own state words. This rule fixes only where the word is rendered.
5. Every item and every implementation record carries a suffix. Each carries a state line from the moment it is written, and the in-progress state of each is **Active**.
6. A name with no suffix is a defect.
7. A note's suffix is always `-RECORDED`.
8. The file's contents are unchanged. Add no suffix to any file's contents.
9. The state inside the file is the `**State:**` line and nothing else.
10. The file still ends with its provenance footer.

## Upper case, and the exception it takes

1. The suffix is the stated exception to the file-names rule's dash-separated, lower-case name.
2. The upper case marks the state as not part of the record's subject. `…-ooda-terminology-REFUTED.md`, not `…-ooda-terminology-refuted.md`.
3. The dash is the ordinary separator. Nothing else about the name changes.
4. The ISO-8601-UTC prefix is untouched, so the directory still sorts chronologically.

## The `**State:**` line stays the only authoritative statement

1. The name is derived from the line. It changes only when the line changes.
2. Where name and line disagree, the line is right and the name is stale.
3. A state change renames the file, using `git mv`.
4. When a reversible word is taken back, rename the file to the state the record returns to, such as **ACTIVE** or **OPEN**.
5. Any state but Open, Active, and Recorded can be taken back by resume, as the the-items-directory-holds-one-file-per-item rule sets out.
6. A reference to a record omits its state suffix and extension, and keeps the prefix and name. A rename then breaks no reference.
7. A reader finds the record by that prefix and name.
8. Leave historical records as written.

# A record may be tagged with square-bracket tags

Source: system/foundation/source/a-record-may-be-categorized-with-square-bracket-tags.md

Trigger: When adding a tag to a record or a list item

1. Any record may carry tags, such as `[idea]`.
2. Put them on a `**Tags:**` line at the head of the record, after `**State:**` where there is one: `**Tags:** [idea] [decision]`.
3. To tag one list item, prefix it: `- [idea] My idea`.
4. Write a tag lower-case in square brackets, with dashes between words: `[legal-matter]`.
5. Tags are optional and freeform. Add one when it is useful.
6. Nothing checks tags, and there is no fixed list.
7. Some tags have lifecycle states, such as `[experiment]`, `[feature]`, `[note]`, and `[work]`. Each one's own rule states its states.

# A rule's compressed text is written in its source, checked against it, and its figures recorded below the body

Source: system/foundation/source/a-rules-compressed-text-is-written-in-its-source-checked-against-it-and-its-figures-recorded-below-the-body.md

Trigger: When editing a source rule's body, or writing, revising, or checking a rule's compressed text

1. A source rule may carry a compressed text: the rule restated with the same effect and outcome, in fewer words.
2. Write it in a `## Compressed` section below the body. It shares the source's title and `Related:` list.
3. The body stays the authority. Never edit the compressed text apart from it.

## The compressed text

1. Write the compressed text as numbered lists. Each point is one or two short sentences, carrying one directive.
2. Headings within the section group the points, and each group's list numbers from 1.
3. Carry no reasons. They stay in the body. Where a reason constrains what is done, state that constraint as a directive.
4. Keep a fenced example the directives depend on.
5. A change to the body reaches the compressed text in the same commit.
6. A point keeps its number where it can, so a check's verdicts and a reader's references still find it.
7. `./compile.sh` writes each package's `rules-pre-loaded.md`, at the package root, holding every rule in its `source/`: each rule's title, a `Source:` line with its source path, and its compressed text, or its body where it has none.
8. The rules file carries no `## Compressed` heading, no figures, no `## History` section, no `Related:` list, and no provenance footer.

## The check

1. A compressed text stands only after it is checked against its source. The check has two parts, each done by its own fresh agent that has not seen the compression.
2. A lister lists the source's directives from its body, without the Compressed section, the Compression section, and the footer.
3. A checker judges each directive against the title, the compressed text, and the `Related:` list, as kept, less precise, or lost.
4. Repair a lost directive, and a materially less precise one, with the smallest clause that closes the gap. Check the repaired rule again in full.
5. Where two checkers disagree on a directive, the source decides.
6. Record a less precise directive left as it is, and why.
7. Check a compressed text again after any change to it, except a swap of one term for another the engineer settled.

## The figures

1. Record each compression, revision, and check of a compressed text in its source, in a `## Compression` section below the Compressed section.
2. One line records each event. A later event adds a line, and the earlier lines stay as written.
3. A line gives the date, the event, and its figures.
4. A **compressed** line gives the size rank, the clarity score, and the solubility before and after, the change, the compression, and the directive counts: how many, and how many kept, less precise, and lost.
5. A **revised** line gives the size rank, the clarity score, and the solubility before and after, and the directive counts of the check that followed.
6. A **re-checked** line gives the directive counts and the number of repairs.
7. Name restorations, where a compression put back text it had dropped, on the line of the event that made them.
8. Leave out a figure that was not measured. Do not estimate it.
9. Size rank is the rule's rank by characters among the compiled rules, from 0 for the smallest to 1 for the largest.
10. Clarity score is 1 − unclarity. Unclarity is the mean of six ranks among the compiled rules: average sentence length, share of sentences over 25 words, and history words, asides, citations, and negations per sentence.
11. Solubility is (1 − the mean of the size rank and the unclarity) × 100, as a whole number. Higher is easier to process.
12. Change is the share of the body's words removed, added, or replaced, from a word-level comparison of the body and the compressed text.
13. Compression is the share of the body's characters the compressed text removes.
14. Rank each rule among the compiled rules as they stood at one fixed point in time, commit `770c7eb`, so figures measured at different times compare. The rule-reduction experiment's record, `2026-10-22T04-51-25Z-rule-reduction`, sets out each measure.
15. The process that compresses, revises, or checks the text writes the figures, in the same commit.
16. The package's rules file carries no figures. They stay in the source.

# A suspension is a log entry tagged `[suspended]`, and nothing is moved

Source: system/foundation/source/a-suspension-is-a-log-entry-tagged-suspended-and-nothing-is-moved.md

Trigger: When removing a rule, procedure, or report

1. When the project stops doing something, log it and tag the entry `[suspended]`. That is the whole act.
2. Nothing moves to any directory. Nothing is kept beside the entry, and no copy is kept anywhere.
3. Anything the project *did* can be suspended: a rule that became ceremony, a procedure nobody runs, a report nobody reads, a step that costs more than it is worth. Only what the project did is suspended this way.
4. Something the project only wanted is not suspended this way.
5. An item set aside takes `**State:** Suspended` and stays where it is. That is a different act with a different record.
6. Do not tag an item's log entry `[suspended]`.
7. When something the project does is no longer justified, remove it.

## What the entry carries

1. Like every log entry, the title states what was suspended and why.
2. The why gives what it cost and what it stopped buying.
3. Reconcile whatever cites the removed thing. The entry names, in its own clause, what else changed.
4. For example, removing a rule means dropping it from the package README's summary.
5. The suspended thing's file is removed in the same commit as the entry.
6. Git holds the removed text, reachable by path from `master`'s history.

## The tag

1. The entry carries `**Tags:** [suspended]` under its title, separated by a blank line:

```
# The no-stored-recap rule is suspended, its one sentence folded into the log convention

**Tags:** [suspended]
```

2. This is the one form every record uses, per the a-record-may-be-categorized-with-square-bracket-tags rule. A log entry's tags sit where an item's and an implementation record's do.
3. A log entry may carry other tags beside this one.
4. What `[suspended]` marks is fixed here.
5. The set of suspensions is read from this tag.

# A vocabulary entry says what a term means, not what it was or where to read more

Source: system/foundation/source/a-vocabulary-entry-says-what-a-term-means-not-what-it-was-or-where-to-read-more.md

Trigger: When writing or revising an entry in a vocabulary.md file

1. A vocabulary entry states the term's current meaning and stops there.
2. Write the entry in the present tense, saying what the term means now.
3. Give any distinction against a neighbouring term.
4. An entry records no lifecycle history.
5. Do not record what the term used to name, or what directory it used to sit in.
6. Do not record when the term changed, or what governed it before.
7. When a term changes meaning, moves, or stops being used, write the change in the log, per the the-log-holds-one-file-per-entry-with-a-one-line-title rule.
8. Leave the entry saying only what is true now.
9. An entry carries no pointers.
10. Do not write *Its rule is …* or *see the … rule*. Name no rule the reader should go and read.
11. Send the reader to no other vocabulary, and to no section elsewhere in the file.

## What is not lifecycle history

1. The reason a substitution exists is part of the entry. Say why a substitution substitutes.
2. Example: *`log` is taken by the project's log, and `personal journal` needs a qualifier to hold the two apart*.
3. The STE note stays whole: what the STE dictionary says, the reserved category, and the reservation mechanism its note names.
4. The STE note's own citation is part of the note, not a pointer.
5. A distinction against a neighbouring term stays, and is not a pointer even when it names the neighbour.
6. The test is the tense. A clause carrying a date, an *until*, a *was*, or a *no longer* records a change, and belongs in the log.

## Where the history goes

1. History goes to the log.
2. A discontinuation is not an exception.
3. A discontinuation's entry names the word and says it is not used.
4. It does not narrate when the word was dropped or what carried it before.

# A vocabulary file holds terms, substitutions, and discontinuations, and each word is approved or reserved

Source: system/foundation/source/a-vocabulary-file-holds-terms-substitutions-and-discontinuations-and-each-word-is-approved-or-reserved.md

Trigger: When writing, revising, or creating a `vocabulary.md` file

1. This rule governs writing a vocabulary. The a-packages-vocabulary-holds-its-terms-and-the-most-specific-one-decides rule governs using one.
2. Give a package a vocabulary only when its domain has specialized words.
3. A package whose subject is written in ordinary words has no vocabulary. The absence is correct, not missing.
4. `git` and `ext/ruby-lang` have none. Six packages do.
5. Put a term in the vocabulary of the package whose domain it belongs to.
6. Put a domain-less term or substitution in `language`. Put a domain-specific substitution in its own package's vocabulary.

## What a vocabulary holds

1. **Terms** are the concepts the package defines, such as `solubility`, `efferent`, `hinge`, `precondition`.
2. A term is a glossary entry, and it says what the concept is.
3. **Substitutions** name a word not to write, and the word to write instead. Examples: `conform` rather than "sweep", `verified` rather than "green".
4. **Discontinuations** name a word removed from use with nothing in its place, because the concept went, as `discriminator` did.
5. A substitution names two words. A discontinuation names one.
6. Keep substitutions and discontinuations under separate headings. Do not file one under the other's heading.
7. A word Slasher did not coin is still a term where the vocabulary says what it means, and is entered as one. Examples: `load-bearing`, `cradle`, `preserve`.
8. Where a word was taken rather than coined, the entry says so in its own prose.
9. That statement is an **origin**, not a kind of entry.

## Every word in a vocabulary is approved or reserved

1. Every word in a vocabulary is approved or reserved. This holds for its terms and for the Use column of its substitutions.
2. An approved word is approved in the STE dictionary and used with its approved meaning. Nothing further is required.
3. A reserved word is a technical noun or verb in a category its entry names: under STE Rule 1.5 for a noun the dictionary omits, STE Rule 1.6 for a noun it lists and refuses, STE Rule 1.12 for a verb, or an ETE category under the ete-declares-its-own-categories rule. The vocabulary that holds it is the approval STE Rule 1.8 requires.
4. A reserved word's entry states what the STE dictionary says about it: absent, refused with an alternative, or approved with a meaning Slasher does not use. The last is governed by the ete-fixes-the-meaning-of-a-word-in-its-category rule.
5. Reserve a word by the sequence the a-word-is-reserved-in-six-steps rule gives, in the `language` package's `ete/` directory.
6. A definition with no STE note reserves a term absent from the dictionary. A substitution's Use word with no STE note is ordinary vocabulary, which is not reserved and not rewritten.
7. One line at a vocabulary's head says that every word in it is approved or reserved, and cites this rule. The vocabulary does not repeat the rule.

## A project's own vocabulary is `slasher/local/vocabulary.md`

1. It is one file, beside `rules/`, holding the terms and substitutions a project settles for itself.
2. It has the same shape as a package's `vocabulary.md`.
3. It takes no datetime prefix. It is a structural file, not a dated decision. See the file-names rule.
4. It is read at session start and binds, as the a-packages-vocabulary-holds-its-terms-and-the-most-specific-one-decides rule says. That is why it sits beside `rules/`, not in a working directory.
5. It is optional, and its absence is not a defect.
6. Write no such file until there is a term to write.
7. It is not a rule. Do not put it in `rules/`.

## Saying how an entry relates to a general term

1. Where a package narrows a term, its entry names the general term it narrows.
2. Where a package keeps a word the `language` vocabulary substitutes away, its entry says so and gives the reason.
3. A reader must not have to work out which case an entry is. The entry says whether it narrows or replaces the general term.

# An implementation runs on a branch to a declared end

Source: system/foundation/source/an-implementation-runs-on-a-branch-to-a-declared-end.md

Trigger: When starting, adding a worktree to, suspending, or concluding an experiment or feature implementation

1. An implementation runs on its own branch, designed through the five hinges by DBE, to a declared state.
2. It is never left silently open.
3. Whether the work states a forecast decides the parts that differ while it runs. Whether it reaches a verdict is asked at its end. The tag names the record and the branch, and decides nothing else.
4. Either kind opens with a question or an intent. A forecast is stated at the start only where the engineer gives one. Only work with a forecast is asked the verdict question, and the engineer can conclude any work with a verdict word (see the the-implementations-directory-holds-one-record-per-implementation rule).
5. A clause below names work with a forecast, or with or without a verdict, only because of that difference. Every other clause holds for all.

## The branch

1. `new` creates the branch and writes the record `Open`. `start` makes it `Active`.
2. Name it `experiment/<subject>` or `feature/<subject>`, matching the tag.
3. The subject is short, lower-case, and dash-separated, and names literally what is tested or built.
4. Add `-run-<n>` only where the work has more than one run.
5. With a worktree, the name carries `worktree/`: `experiment/worktree/<subject>`, `feature/worktree/<subject>`.
6. A branch checked out in a worktree cannot be checked out in the main working tree, and `git branch` is where that question comes up.
7. Adding a worktree to work under way renames the branch.
8. The rename is confirmed, and the record carries it.
9. Keep the upstream branch out of the name, since a branch can outlive its upstream target. The record names it.
10. A worktree is the one fact the name carries, because `git branch` has no other answer for it.
11. The rename keeps that fact current.
12. Record the branch, its upstream, and its base. Record the base as its commit SHA and the ref it came from.
13. Make no git tag for the base.
14. A later run branches from the recorded commit.

## Phases

1. An experiment or a feature may run in phases. Each phase is a question or an intent that serves the implementation's.
2. The record names the phases and their order at the start, and, as each phase starts, the commit it branched from.
3. When a phase is added, ask whether it states a forecast, whatever its implementation chose: *No forecast*, then *State a forecast*. A phase with a forecast states it before its work. When its work is complete, ask it the verdict question, with the implementation's three options. A phase without a forecast is not asked.
4. A phase's branch is the implementation's branch, a dot, and the phase's name: `experiment/rule-reduction.flattening`, `feature/worktree/skills.slash-commands`.
5. Git refuses a slash here, because no branch can sit beneath another branch's name.
6. A `worktree/` segment carries into each phase's name.
7. A phase branches from the implementation's branch and concludes into it.
8. Where the phase is concluded with a verdict, it is affirmed, refuted, or inconclusive only on the engineer's declaration.
9. An affirmed phase merges back into the implementation's branch.
10. The record carries each phase's verdict and findings.
11. Where the phase is concluded without a verdict, or has no forecast, it concludes Completed, with no verdict, and merges back into the implementation's branch.
12. One phase runs at a time, in the record's order, each from the implementation's branch as the earlier phases left it.
13. A phase's commits reach no other branch.
14. The implementation concludes after its phases, and only then merges to its upstream branch.
15. Merge a concluded phase with `git merge --no-ff`. Squash a phase's commits when the implementation concludes, not when the phase does. Read each phase's commits from the start the record names to the phase's branch. Drop each phase's `--no-ff` merge commit, since its squashed commit takes its place. Before the implementation merges to its upstream branch, rebuild its branch so each merged phase is one squashed commit, in the phases' order.
16. A commit made outside any phase keeps its content and its message, in its place. Its SHA changes. Where the branch was pushed, force-push the rebuilt branch with `--force-with-lease` against the pushed tip, on the engineer's selection.
17. The squashed commit's subject summarizes what the phase built, under the commit-message rules. Its body lists the phase's own commit subjects, oldest first, each on its own line after a dash.
18. A refuted or inconclusive phase does not merge, so nothing of it is squashed.
19. Keep a phase's branch until the implementation concludes. Delete it with the implementation's branch.

## The working location

1. Put the working location through the selection interface at every start, with no default.
2. Each option states what it creates:

> **Branch only** — Create the branch and switch this working tree to it. At the conclusion this
> working tree switches back.
>
> **Branch and worktree** — Create the branch as `<kind>/worktree/<subject>` and check it out in a
> new worktree: a second working directory at `<path>`. This working tree stays on
> `<upstream branch>`.
>
> **The current branch** — Build it where the working tree already is, creating nothing. There is
> no branch to switch back to and nothing to merge.

3. Choosing the current branch rules out a forecast and a verdict. Work built there states no forecast, concludes Completed, and is not asked the verdict question.
4. The changes of work with a forecast must not reach the branch it deviates from before it is affirmed, and its own branch is what keeps them out.
5. Work without a forecast is the main line.
6. Offer the current branch last, because a first option reads as recommended, and the current branch gives up isolation.
7. The current branch's cost: there is no isolation, partial work sits where others read, and abandoning means reverting rather than deleting a branch.
8. On the current branch, the record still carries the intent, the state, and the confirmations.
9. Place a worktree beside the repository directory, named `<repository-name>-<branch, each slash as a dash>`, as in `slasher-experiment-state-suffix-legibility`.
10. A worktree inside the repository would show as untracked content in the work's own `git status`.
11. Create a branch-only implementation with `git switch -c <branch>`, and a worktree implementation with `git worktree add -b <branch> <path>`, where `-b` is required.
12. Use `git worktree add <path> <branch>` only to add a worktree to work under way, since it fails on a branch that does not exist.
13. Change the location only by adding a worktree.
14. Add one only on one of two triggers: other work arrives that the engineer means to work alongside.
15. Or the work is escalated, needing more isolation than it was taken for.
16. Confirm the addition.
17. Add a line to the record, and keep the original.
18. The conclusion follows the location as it then stands.
19. Never collapse a worktree back.

## Participation

1. Put attended or unattended through the selection interface beside the working location.
2. Attended is the default.
3. The design-by-efferent attended-or-unattended-is-chosen-when-the-work-is-started rule states why the two sit at one gate, and what changes between them.
4. Record both choices.

## The forecast and the verdict

1. At the start, ask whether the work states a forecast, through the selection interface, beside the working location and the participation. Its options read *No forecast*, then *State a forecast*, in that order. Record the answer as a confirmation, and write a stated forecast in the record.
2. Do not ask it where the working location is the current branch. Work there states no forecast.
3. Whether the work states a forecast follows neither the kind nor whether it opens with a question or an intent.
4. At the end, when the work is complete, ask the verdict question of work with a forecast, and of no other work. Record the answer as a confirmation.
5. Its two options read, in these words and in this order: *Conclude without an engineer's verdict*, then *Conclude with an engineer's verdict*.
6. Work concluded without a verdict ends Completed. Work concluded with one ends Affirmed, Refuted, or Inconclusive, on the engineer's declaration. Work without a forecast is not asked. `complete` concludes it Completed, and the engineer can conclude it with a verdict word instead.
7. A third option reads *What's a verdict?* Selecting it explains, in a sentence or two, that a verdict is the engineer's declaration that the work is Affirmed, Refuted, or Inconclusive, against the forecast stated before the work, and that work without a verdict ends Completed.
8. Then ask the question again, with the same three options.

## The end

1. Every implementation ends in a declared state, or is suspended, which pauses it.
2. The words are the the-implementations-directory-holds-one-record-per-implementation rule's.
3. Work that reaches a verdict is affirmed only on the engineer's explicit declaration.
4. On affirmation, its log is copied into the project log.
5. Where it produced implementation, its branch merges to the upstream branch, after the tests pass.
6. Where no test covers the work, the merge also waits for specific confirmation.
7. Observation-only work's affirmation is the log copy alone.
8. Work that reaches a verdict and will merge brings what master needs to conform to it: every rule its practice needs, and every other change, on its branch before it merges.
9. Work without a verdict merges with no gate, because every commit was verified under the run-the-test-suite-after-changes-before-considering-whether-to-commit rule.
10. The merged result can still break the suite, and that is fixed from there.
11. Work without a verdict has no affirmation.
12. Refuted, inconclusive, abandoned, and superseded work keeps its record, marked with its state, so the attempt and its findings survive.
13. Refuted, inconclusive, abandoned, and superseded work does not merge.
14. Supersede an implementation at any time, without suspending it first.
15. Keep the superseded implementation's branch until the engineer confirms its deletion.
16. The two records name each other.
17. A child supersedes its parent by preserving it.
18. The child merges the parent first, taking every commit the parent made after the child branched.
19. The parent is then parked Superseded, and the records name each other.
20. The child takes the parent's upstream.
21. The parent branch is deleted only on confirmation.
22. This is the one supersession that merges the superseded branch.
23. Conclude in the main working tree, on the upstream branch.
24. Under branch only, the working tree switches back.
25. Under a worktree, end the session in the main working tree, never in the removed directory.
26. On the current branch there is nothing to return from.
27. Branch deletion takes one confirmation from the engineer, through the selection interface. It covers the worktree removal, the kept phase branches, and the implementation's branch on the remote where it was pushed. Delete the remote branch only after the upstream branch holding the work has been pushed. Do not prompt twice. Delete a squashed phase's branch with `git branch -D`, since git refuses `-d` for it.
28. Remove the worktree first, since git refuses to delete a branch checked out in a worktree.
29. Suspension deletes no branch and removes no worktree.

## The agent never raises the end of work with a forecast

1. Do not offer to conclude, affirm, refute, or merge one: not as a next step, an option, or a precondition.
2. Report what is settled and what is open, and stop.
3. The length of work with a forecast is the engineer's judgment, not readable from the work done.
4. Work without a forecast is not covered, because its completion is ordinary.

## Drift

1. While work with a forecast is open under branch only, watch for main-sequence work starting, and surface it.
2. Offer two recourses through the selection interface: suspend the implementation, where the intent is to stop working it for now, or add a worktree, where the intent is to keep working it alongside.
3. Neither recourse ends the implementation, and the engineer's intent decides.
4. The watch rests on the branch name in the status line and on a judgment of whether the work serves the recorded question or intent.
5. The watch is a practice, not a guarantee.
6. Under a worktree there is nothing to watch. The session-start notice reports every implementation that has not concluded.
7. Work without a forecast has no watch, since starting other work during it is ordinary.

# An item that sequences work contains no code samples

Source: system/foundation/source/an-item-that-sequences-work-contains-no-code-samples.md

Trigger: When writing or revising an item in slasher/local/items/ that sequences work

1. An item in `slasher/local/items/` that sequences work must never contain code samples, whatever its tags name it.
2. Such a plan contains no code blocks.
3. It contains no literal method bodies.
4. It contains no "write this content" snippets.
5. Describe each step's intent and expected outcome in prose only.
6. Avoid over-prescription. Do not commit up front to specific method names, file names, or other implementation details not yet known or decided.
7. State the goal and the behavior only at the altitude that is genuinely settled.
8. Leave the rest open rather than inventing names to fill the plan.
9. This applies when writing a plan and when revising one.
10. At implementation time, generate code only on the user's explicit instruction.
11. Generate it in the increments the user chooses.

# Anything given to `/private` is recorded only in the private directory

Source: system/foundation/source/anything-given-to-private-is-recorded-only-in-the-private-directory.md

Trigger: When the engineer types `/private`, or asks to write, read, or list a private record, or starts or ends a private session

**Trigger:** When the engineer types `/private`, or asks to write, read, or list a private record, or starts or ends a private session

1. A private record is a record the engineer keeps for a project outside the project's repository. It is not committed with the project.
2. Anything given to `/private` is recorded only in the private directory. Nothing of it is written into the project.
3. A private record is a document, an item, a log entry, or a journal entry. In a private session, it is also a work session record, an implementation record, or a loop record.
4. Its contents are what the engineer directs. Write the engineer's words, or what the engineer asks the agent to write. Add nothing on your own initiative.

## The private directory

1. Every private record is under one root, `~/.local/share/slasher/`. Per-machine settings stay under `~/.config/slasher/`, which this root does not share.
2. Each kind has its own directory under the root, and each project has one directory in each kind's directory. The project's directory is named for the project's repository directory.
3. In a git worktree, the project's directory is named for the main repository's directory, not the worktree's. Every worktree of a project and its main checkout use one directory. Read the name from the parent of `git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir`.

| Kind | Directory |
|---|---|
| document | `~/.local/share/slasher/documents/<project>/` |
| item | `~/.local/share/slasher/items/<project>/` |
| log entry | `~/.local/share/slasher/log/<project>/` |
| journal entry | `~/.local/share/slasher/journal/<project>/` |
| work session record | `~/.local/share/slasher/work-sessions/<project>/` |
| implementation record | `~/.local/share/slasher/implementations/<project>/` |
| loop record | `~/.local/share/slasher/loops/<project>/` |

4. One file in a project's directory is one record.
5. No directory has a `<username>` directory. The private directory belongs to one user.
6. A directory may not exist, and its absence is ordinary. Make it when the first record of its kind for that project is written.

## What `/private` records

1. **A file path**, as in `/private notes/pricing.md`: copy that file to the private directory, into the project's documents directory there, with its name and content unchanged. The copy is a private document. The original stays where it is.
2. **`item <words>`**: write a private item.
3. **`log <words>`**: write a private log entry.
4. **`journal <words>`**: write a private journal entry, by the journal package's private-journal-convention, as `/journal private` does.
5. **`session <instruction>`**: start a private session, and carry out the instruction in it.
6. **`session end`**: end the private session.
7. Words that are not a subcommand and not a path to an existing file are not guessed at. Say so, and ask which subcommand is meant, through the selection interface.

## A private session

1. `/private session <instruction>` starts a private session. It lasts until the session ends, or until `/private session end`.
2. In a private session, every record the agent writes goes to the private directory, in the directory for its kind, and never into the project. That holds for a record the engineer asks for and for a record a rule asks for.
3. A record is a file under `slasher/local/` that a rule tells the agent to write: an item, a log entry, a journal entry, a work session record, an implementation record, or a loop record.
4. Carry out the instruction after `session` in the private session. Where no instruction was typed, start the private session and wait for the engineer's request.
5. When the private session starts, say once that the session's records go to the private directory. Say it again when it ends.
6. A file that is not a record still changes in the project, as the work asks. Code, a test, a rule, a vocabulary, a README, and a skill are not records.
7. The log-entry hook still writes into the project's log. In a private session, move each entry it writes to the private log directory, before anything is committed.
8. Commit no record written in a private session, and log nothing in the project about the private session.
9. A record that already exists in the project stays there. Do not change its state or its content in a private session. Where the work asks for that change, say so, and ask, through the selection interface, whether to end the private session first.
10. A private session does not reach another session. A record written in another session at the same time goes into the project as usual.

## A private session times out

1. A private session times out when 4 minutes pass with no prompt from the engineer.
2. The plugin's hook on each prompt keeps the time. `/private session` writes the session's state file, in `~/.local/state/slasher/private-sessions/`, named for the session. Each prompt in the private session writes its time there. `/private session end` removes the file.
3. Where a prompt comes more than 4 minutes after the last one, the hook tells the agent so. Before anything else, ask the engineer, through the selection interface, whether to continue the private session or end it.
4. The options are **Continue** and **End**. Continue keeps the private session, and its 4 minutes count from the prompt that brought the question.
5. End ends the private session: delete the state file the hook names, and say that the session's records go into the project again.
6. Then take up the prompt that brought the question, under what the engineer selected.
7. The question carries no decision marker, and nothing about it is logged.

## A private record's shape

1. **A document** keeps the name of the file given. It takes no datetime prefix, no state suffix, and no provenance footer.
2. **An item** takes an item's shape: the ISO-8601-UTC prefix, the state suffix, a `**State:**` line, a `**Tags:**` line, and the provenance footer.
3. **A log entry** takes a log entry's shape: the ISO-8601-UTC prefix and a one-line title, with a `**Tags:**` line or a body where it needs one.
4. **A journal entry** takes the shape the private-journal-convention gives it.
5. **A work session record, an implementation record, or a loop record** takes the shape its own rule gives it, with no log entry in the project and no commit.
6. Where a file of that name is already there, ask, through the selection interface, whether to replace it or to use another name.

## Only on the engineer's command

1. Write, read, or list a private record only when the engineer asks for it. A private session is the engineer's request for every record the session writes.
2. `/private read` reads the record the engineer names. `/private list` lists the project's private records, of every kind or of the kind named.
3. Do not read a private record at session start.
4. Do not read one to answer a question, unless the engineer names it.
5. Do not offer to write a private record, or name the private directory as a place to put something.
6. Log nothing in the project about a private record: not its creation, a change to it, its being read, or its move into the project. This holds where another rule asks for a log entry.
7. A private item takes no log entry in the project when it is written or when its state changes.
8. A private record takes no commit.
9. Whether the private directory is under version control is the engineer's decision. Neither ask for it nor forbid it.

## Moving a private record into the project

1. A private record moves into the project only on the engineer's command.
2. The engineer names where it goes. Where the engineer names no place, ask, through the selection interface.
3. Before the move, name the record and its destination, and ask, through the selection interface, whether to move it. The move publishes it to every reader of the repository.
4. Move the file with its content unchanged, and remove it from the private directory.
5. It is then a file of the project. Where it goes under `slasher/local/`, it takes that directory's conventions from then on.
6. A private journal entry moves by the private-journal-convention.
7. Nothing else moves a private record. Do not offer to move one.

## What private does not promise

1. Private means kept out of the project's repository and out of the session-start read, and nothing more.
2. It does not keep a record on the machine. A record the agent writes or reads is plain text in the session. It reaches the model provider, the local transcript, and any hook that is installed.

**Why:** an engineer has material about a project that is not for the project's repository: a draft not ready to share, a note about a person, an idea not ready to be seen, or a document from someone else. Kept in the repository, it is committed and read by every reader. Kept anywhere else, the agent cannot find it. One command that records only in a fixed directory per project, read only on command, keeps it at hand without publishing it.

**How to apply:** when the engineer types `/private`, record what was given in the project's directory for its kind under `~/.local/share/slasher/`. Do only the act asked for, write nothing into the project, log nothing, and commit nothing. In a private session, write every record there until the session or the private session ends.

# Ask-again puts the last question again

Source: system/foundation/source/ask-again-puts-the-last-question-again.md

Trigger: When the engineer types `/ask-again` or `/aa`, or asks for the last question again

**Trigger:** When the engineer types `/ask-again` or `/aa`, or asks for the last question again

**`/ask-again` puts the last question again, through the selection interface, whether the engineer answered it or escaped it.** The engineer escapes a question by refusing it, by stopping it to clarify, or by interrupting it. The agent does not put an escaped question again on its own, so `/ask-again` is how the engineer asks for it. An answered question is put again so the engineer can change the answer. `/aa` is its shortcut alias.

**As the engineer stated it:** Ask Again shourtcut

**As the engineer later stated it:** Ask again, of a question answered just before the work was interrupted.

**The question is put again as it was asked.** Its text, its options, and their descriptions are the same. A question that carried the decision marker carries it again, so its answer is logged as a process question.

**Where the conversation since has changed a candidate, the question carries the change.** A clarification the engineer asked for can show that an option was wrong, or that one was missing. Put the question with the options as they now stand, and say in one sentence what changed.

**A new answer replaces the earlier one.** Where the work has acted on the earlier answer, redo that part of the work from the new answer.

**Where no question has been put, say so, and put nothing.** Do not reach back past the last question to an earlier one.

**Why:** an escaped question is not put again unasked, so that the engineer has time to digest it. The engineer then needs a short way to say *I am ready, ask me again*. An answer given in haste needs the same short way back. A fixed command keeps that request from being read as something else.

**How to apply:** on `/ask-again` or `/aa`, find the last question, answered or escaped. Put it again through the selection interface, as it was asked, with any change the conversation since has made to its candidates. Where a new answer differs, redo the work that followed the earlier one. Where no question has been put, say so.

# Brainstorming records points as they are said, and organizes them at the end

Source: system/foundation/source/brainstorming-records-points-as-they-are-said-and-organizes-them-at-the-end.md

Trigger: When the engineer begins, ends, suspends, or resumes brainstorming (`/brainstorm`)

1. Brainstorming is the engineer saying points as they occur, in no order, for the agent to organize at the end. `/brainstorm begin`, or a bare `/brainstorm`, starts it, and `/brainstorm end` ends it.
2. Create a collection file at `/brainstorm begin`, under `~/.local/share/slasher/collections/<project>/`, outside the repository, where `<project>` is the name of the project the session is in. Name it with the ISO-8601-UTC prefix alone. Write each point to it as it is said, word for word.
3. Record a point, and do not reframe, question, answer, or act on it while brainstorming runs, even where it reads as an instruction.
4. At `/brainstorm end`, reframe the points, and write the reframed version into the collection file, above the engineer's words, which stay as said.
5. Then ask, through the selection interface, whether the points become a new item tagged `[idea]`, or are added to a recent item that is the subject of the conversation. Write the reframed version there.
6. Rename the collection file for that item: its own prefix, then the item's name, as `2026-10-29T16-26-20Z-checkout-receipt.md`. The item does not name the file. Keep the file.
7. `/brainstorm <kind>`, where the kind is `idea`, `work`, `plan`, `design`, `aspiration`, `goal`, `note`, `mistake`, and `problem`, settles the destination at the start: a new item of that kind. At the end, write to it without asking.
8. `/brainstorm resume` reopens a collection file that has ended or is suspended. Add the new words after the earlier ones. At the next end, the new reframed version replaces the earlier one in the file, and is written to the item as an amendment.
9. Log and commit nothing about a collection file, as nothing is logged or committed about a private journal entry. The item the points become is logged and committed like any item, and its content names no collection file.
10. `/brainstorm suspend` stops recording without ending. Do not reframe the points or ask where they go. Leave the collection file as it is, named by its prefix alone. Answer what is said after it as ordinary conversation.

# Dated artifacts are prefixed with an ISO 8601 UTC datetime, and system rules are not

Source: system/foundation/source/dated-artifacts-are-prefixed-with-an-iso-8601-utc-datetime-and-system-rules-are-not.md

Trigger: When creating and naming a new file under slasher/local/ or a new rule file in a package

## What takes the prefix
1. A dated artifact takes the datetime prefix. A dated artifact is something a project accrues over time, ordered by when it was made.
2. The contemporaneous, historical records under `logs/` take it: the log (`logs/log/`), `logs/loops/`, and `logs/work-sessions/`.
3. The work-artifact directories `items/`, `implementations/`, and `migration/` take it.
4. A consuming project's own local rules, the ones it adds to its `slasher/local/rules/`, take it. A local rule is a dated decision in that project's history.
5. Prefix every new working-state artifact with the full `YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SSZ-` UTC datetime.
6. Prefix every local rule a project adds the same way.

## Format
1. The prefix is an ISO 8601 datetime normalized to UTC. A dash-separated, lower-case name and `.md` follow it.
2. **Format:** `YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SSZ-<name>.md`.
3. Join the date and time with `T`. The trailing `Z` marks UTC.
4. Write the time's colons as dashes, for filesystem safety, as in `2026-07-01T20-40-00Z-some-name.md`.
5. The name is dash-separated and lower-case.
6. The state suffix is the one exception to the lower case.
7. A record carrying a canonical `**State:**` line ends its name with that state word in upper case, after a dash: `2026-08-05T19-37-06Z-ooda-terminology-REFUTED.md`.
8. The suffix changes nothing else about the name, and leaves the prefix untouched.
9. The a-record-carrying-a-state-line-ends-its-filename-with-the-state-in-upper-case rule fixes the suffix.

## What takes no prefix
1. System rules do not take the prefix.
2. Name a rule in a distributed package (`foundation`, `language`, `testing`, …) by a dash-separated, lower-case name alone. An example is `write-subject-first-commit-messages.md`, not `2026-…-subject-first-commit-messages.md`.
3. A package's structural files take no prefix. These are `README.md`, `vocabulary.md`, and `install-dependencies.sh`, each named by what it is.
4. A project's own `slasher/local/vocabulary.md` takes no prefix.

# Disclosure is the one reason to edit a historical record

Source: system/foundation/source/disclosure-is-the-one-reason-to-edit-a-historical-record.md

Trigger: When about to edit a historical record (a log entry, work session record, implementation record, or completed migration record), or when the engineer says a record discloses something it should not

1. A historical record states what was true when it was written.
2. Historical records include log entries, work session records, experiment records, feature records, and completed migration records.
3. Do not revise a historical record to suit a later convention.
4. Do not rename, reformat, or correct a since-replaced term in a historical record.
5. Do not revise it for any other reason a reader might want it to read differently.
6. The one exception is disclosure.
7. Where a record names something that should not have been disclosed, correct it.

## What counts

1. The test is whether the content is the project's to publish, not whether it is wrong.
2. Another party's project, client, or repository, named only incidentally, is not the project's to publish.
3. A path, hostname, or machine layout describing someone's environment rather than the work is not the project's to publish.
4. A credential, key, or token is not the project's to publish, and is a security matter first.
5. Anything the engineer says should not be there is not the project's to publish.
6. The engineer, not the agent, is the authority on what should not be there. Do not scrub a record on a guess.
7. Judge a record's reach as beyond its repository, since repositories are public and rules are installed on other people's machines.

## Reduce resolution rather than falsify

1. Reduce resolution rather than falsify.
2. Remove the disclosure and keep the record true.
3. Remove only the naming.
4. A record that reached three projects still reads as having reached three.
5. *"Each of the three projects holding it"* is less specific than three names and is not less accurate.
6. Never make the record say something that did not happen.
7. Never delete an increment that ran, change a count, or reattribute work.
8. Where the removal leaves a reader unable to follow what happened, state in the record what class of thing was removed and why.

## What this does not reach

1. The correction does not reach the git history or any component repository the content was published to.
2. Rewriting that history is the engineer's decision, not a consequence of this rule.
3. When a correction is made, tell the engineer what the edit did and did not accomplish. Say that the git history and any component repository still hold the removed content.
4. Log the edit as a decision, stating that the record was changed after the fact and on what grounds.

# Estimate-confidence gives the agent's confidence of proceeding unattended

Source: system/foundation/source/estimate-confidence-gives-the-agents-confidence-of-proceeding-unattended.md

Trigger: When the engineer types `/estimate-confidence` or `/%`, or asks for the agent's confidence of proceeding unattended

**Trigger:** When the engineer types `/estimate-confidence` or `/%`, or asks for the agent's confidence of proceeding unattended

**`/estimate-confidence` gives the agent's confidence of finishing the work under way on its own, from where the work stands.** `/%` is its alias. The work is the one the conversation is on, found as `/next?` finds it. Where that is not clear, ask which, through the selection interface. Where no work is under way, say so.

**Give five figures, each the agent's own estimate for this work, made when the command is typed.** Each figure is followed by its fixed sentence, in parentheses:

- Agent's confidence: 55% (how sure the agent is about working alone.)
- Risk of redo: 45% (how likely it is that you will have to redo work the agent does.)
- It'll work: 80% (how sure the agent is that what it builds on its own does what it says.)
- Your approval: 55% (how sure the agent is that it does what you would do: naming, shaping, and deciding things as you would.)
- Attended confidence: 85%

**The figures are worked out as they are where the work starts.** The agent's confidence is estimated directly, and is never higher than the lower of It'll work and Your approval. The risk of redo is 100% minus the agent's confidence, computed and not estimated. The attended confidence is about the It'll work figure, or a little higher. Where the agent's confidence is 70% or lower, end the figures with the line *When the agent's confidence is 70% or lower, intervention is indicated.*

**Below the figures, say what raises It'll work and what lowers Your approval**, each as a short list of what remains in the work. Change nothing. The command reports, and it does not switch the work to unattended or ask whether to.

**Why:** the engineer can ask, at any point in the work, how far the agent could be trusted to go on alone, in the same terms the work was started in.

**How to apply:** on `/estimate-confidence` or `/%`, estimate the figures for the rest of the work under way, print them with their sentences, add the warning line where it applies, list what drives the two figures, and stop.

# Idk answers the last question with "I don't know"

Source: system/foundation/source/idk-answers-the-last-question-with-i-dont-know.md

Trigger: When the engineer types `/idk`, or answers the agent's question with "I don't know"

**Trigger:** When the engineer types `/idk`, or answers the agent's question with "I don't know"

**`/idk` answers the agent's last question with "I don't know".** The engineer cannot select an option, because they do not know enough to decide. `/idk` is not a selection. Do not take it as one, and do not choose an option for the engineer.

**As the engineer stated it:** "/idk" command that says "I don't know" to the agent

**The agent first explains the question.** Say in one or two plain sentences what the question decides. Then give each option in one line: what it does and what follows from it. Show an example where one makes the difference clear. Use no reserved term the engineer may not know without its plain meaning.

**Words after `/idk` say what the engineer does not know.** `/idk what a partial refund is` asks about the partial refund. Answer those words first, then explain only what else the decision needs.

**Then the agent gives its recommendation and its reason.** Name the option it recommends, and say in one sentence why. Where no option is better than another for this work, say so, and say what would make one better.

**Then the agent puts the question again.** Put it through the selection interface, with its text and its options as they were. List the recommended option first, with *(Recommended)* after its label. A question that carried the decision marker carries it again.

**Where no question has been put, say so, and put nothing.** Do not invent a question to answer.

**Why:** a selection asks the engineer to decide, and the engineer cannot decide what they do not understand. Without a way to say so, the engineer guesses an option or stops the question. A guess records a decision the engineer did not make. A stopped question waits for `/ask-again`, and the engineer still does not know. `/idk` turns the gap into an explanation, so the engineer decides with the knowledge they need.

**How to apply:** on `/idk`, find the last question put. Explain it and its options in plain words, answering any words typed after `/idk`. Give the recommendation and its reason. Put the question again through the selection interface, with the recommended option first. Where no question has been put, say so.

# Next takes the next step of the work under way, and next? names it

Source: system/foundation/source/next-takes-the-next-step-of-the-work-under-way.md

Trigger: When the engineer types `/next`, `/next`, or `/next?`, or asks what is next

1. `/next?` asks what the next step is, as the engineer asking *What's next?* would. `/next` takes it, as the engineer saying *proceed* would. `/proceed` and `/..` are aliases of `/next`.
2. The work under way is any work with steps still to take: a plan's unchecked tasks, an implementation's phases, an outcome's design hinges, a list of steps the agent gave, a procedure part done. Interrupted work is still under way, and `/next` resumes it where it stopped. The next step is the first not yet taken.
3. On `/next?`, name the next step, or the step where interrupted work stopped, and what it would do, in a sentence or two, and do not take it.
4. On `/next`, take the next step and nothing beyond it, then stop. Where the agent is suggesting an action, one its last response offered, that action is the next step.
5. Follow the work the conversation is on. Where that is not clear, ask which, through the selection interface. Where no work is under way, say so.
6. `/next` does not stand in for a decision or declaration a rule leaves to the engineer, such as affirming an experiment, committing on `master`, or deleting a branch. It brings the step to that decision, and asks it as the step's rule says.

# Package refresh and install run foundation's scripts

Source: system/foundation/source/package-refresh-and-install-run-foundations-scripts.md

Trigger: When the engineer asks to refresh or install Slasher's packages, as with `/package refresh` or `/package install`

1. `/package refresh [<package>...]` refreshes the installed packages from their repositories. Run foundation's `refresh-packages.sh` with the packages named, or none for every one. Report each package that moved and its changed rule files, as the script prints them.
2. `/package install` installs Slasher into the project the session is in. Run foundation's `install.sh` from that project's root. The installer asks before changing a file the project already has.
3. Act only on the project the session is in. Refreshing or installing in another project is the engineer's to ask for there.
4. Never run `/package install` in the Slasher authoring source, whose root `AGENTS.md` it would overwrite with a consuming project's bootstrap.
5. Say that a refreshed or installed rule is read at the next load of the rules: a session restart, or `load rules`.

# Projects lists the registry, and carries out an instruction in another project

Source: system/foundation/source/projects-lists-the-registry-and-carries-out-an-instruction-in-another-project.md

Trigger: When the engineer asks for the Slasher projects on this machine, or asks for an instruction to be carried out in another project, as with `/projects`, `/projects -base`, `/projects -system`, or `/projects <name>`

1. `/projects` lists the Slasher projects registered on this machine, from within any project. Run foundation's `read-consuming-projects.sh`, which reads `~/.config/slasher/consuming-projects.toml`, and print its report. Where there is no registry, say so.
2. `/projects -base <instruction>`, `/projects -system <instruction>`, and `/projects <name> <instruction>` carry out the instruction in the base project, the machine's system project, or the registered project with that name.
3. Resolve the target from the current project's root with `slasher/system/foundation/resolve-project.sh -base`, `-system`, or `<name>`, or `system/foundation/resolve-project.sh` where there is no `slasher/` directory. It prints the target's root.
4. Where the script fails, report its message and do nothing more.
5. Before acting, run the target's loader from the target's root, and follow the rules it prints for the act.
6. Carry out the instruction under the target's root, by the target's conventions. Report what was done and where.
7. A commit in the target waits for the engineer's selection.
8. With a target and no instruction, print the target's root, and act on nothing.
9. Do not change the registry, `slasher.toml`, or `system-project.toml`. Write no project's name into the project the session is in.

# Record a rule's authorship in a provenance footer

Source: system/foundation/source/record-a-rules-authorship-in-a-provenance-footer.md

Trigger: When authoring a new rule file or changing an existing one

1. Every rule file ends with a provenance footer. It records who authored the rule and when, and who has changed it since.
2. The footer sits at the end of the file, after the rule's content, below a `---` divider:

```
---

Authored by <name> on <datetime>
```

3. Each change appends a line. The footer is a running history, never rewritten:

```
---

Authored by <name> on <datetime>
Changed by <name> on <datetime>
Changed by <other name> on <datetime>
```

4. The datetime is human-readable local time, formatted `Mon Jan 1 2026 at 3:45:12 PM PT`.
5. It gives day-of-week, month, day, year, then the time with AM/PM and a timezone abbreviation.
6. The time is in the author's local time.
7. The time carries minutes and seconds, per the a-time-value-carries-minutes-and-seconds rule.
8. The footer does not use the ISO-8601-UTC filename-prefix form.
9. The Authored line names the original author and when the rule was first written.
10. A Changed line is appended each time the rule is edited, oldest first.
11. Never rewrite or remove an earlier line.
12. Earlier lines keep the form they were written in. Lines written at hour resolution stay at hour resolution.
13. Only new lines take the full time. Both forms may coexist in one footer.
14. The name is the contributor's name, as in their git identity.
15. When authoring a new rule, end it with a `---` divider.
16. Below the divider, add an `Authored by <name> on <local datetime>` line.
17. When changing an existing rule, append a `Changed by <name> on <local datetime>` line to its footer.

# Rules may establish a mindset rather than a mechanic

Source: system/foundation/source/rules-may-establish-a-mindset-rather-than-a-mechanic.md

Trigger: When writing or changing a rule file

1. A rule's package names the surface it acts on, such as words, commits, tests, or code. It does not name the purpose the rule serves.
2. Many rules exist to establish a mental stance, a way of thinking about the code and the work, rather than to standardize a mechanic.
3. Purpose is not confined to category. Rules in different packages can serve the same purpose.
4. A rule's real justification is often not visible from its package.
5. Terminology rules are the purest case. Each is an X-not-Y substitution (controls-not-factories, name-concepts-literally-not-by-analogy-code-or-jargon rule) that swaps a word to swap the concept it installs.
6. Terminology rules do not change what the code does.
7. The same purpose recurs under other packages through other levers. The `git` subject-first commit-message rule is a mindset rule reached through grammar (passive voice, indicative mood).
8. That rule states what changed about the code, not what the engineer did, because centering the engineer reinforces anthropocentrism.
9. A rule's reach can exceed the artifact. The no-slang rule extends to conversation with the user, because the mindset it preserves lives in the person.
10. When writing or evaluating a rule, first ask *"what stance does this establish?"*. Do not ask only *"what does it standardize?"*.
11. Place a rule in a package by the surface it acts on.
12. State the rule's purpose, the mindset, in its body.
13. Cross-reference sibling rules that establish the same stance through a different lever, including rules in other packages.
14. When two rules seem to conflict, reconcile them at the level of purpose, not surface.
15. Do not treat package membership as the whole of a rule's meaning.
16. Judge a stance-establishing rule by the mindset it produces, not by surface conformance.
17. A rule that is technically obeyed while the intended stance is absent has failed.

# The harness announces Slasher's installation, and the agent never prints the notice

Source: system/foundation/source/the-harness-announces-slashers-installation-and-the-agent-never-prints-the-notice.md

Trigger: When changing the session-start notice, the startup display, the status line, or their hooks or scripts

1. The harness announces Slasher, through three surfaces it renders.
2. The agent prints no notice, at session start or at any other time.
3. An agent-printed copy would only duplicate the harness's.
4. The agent prints two things at the start, because each needs markdown: the package set stanza, where a project shows one, and the command domain table, at the end of the session-start read.

## The session-start notice

1. The Slasher plugin's `SessionStart` hook runs `slasher/system/foundation/session-start.sh`, which reads the package directories on disk and emits the notice:

```
Slasher installed at slasher/system/ — 5 packages: foundation, language, testing, design-by-efferent, git

3 implementations open: gate-forecasting (no state recorded), shipped-test-tree-script (suspended), upload-retries (suspended)
```

2. The install line enumerates what is on disk.
3. A directory carrying a `README.md` is a package, which tells a grouped package from the grouping directory above it.
4. Nothing prints a fixed list.
5. The open line, after a blank line below the install line, names experiments and features that have not concluded, read from each record's `**State:**` line under `slasher/local/implementations/`.
6. An implementation that is Affirmed, Refuted, Inconclusive, Completed, Abandoned, or Superseded has concluded, whatever its kind.
7. One that is Active, Suspended, or carries no state line is reported.
8. With nothing open, the open line is absent.
9. The open line exists because an implementation must never be left silently open. One worked in a worktree leaves no trace in the main working tree.
10. The notice has no close of its own. It ends with what it reports. The startup display's load line, after it in the same message, says when the rules load and that `/load` loads them now.
11. Something the engineer types is required in any case, since the agent produces nothing until the engineer speaks.
12. This gives up a contentless foil word whose only effect came through the hook's channel. So that channel is no longer testable from ordinary use.
13. The trade of observability for legibility is deliberate.
14. The notice says `installed`, never `loaded`.
15. A hook runs before the session. It can observe that the packages are on disk and the configuration is live, and not that any rule was read.
16. The read instruction describes what the session does next, and reports no read.
17. Call it the session-start notice, not the load notice.
18. The status line reports the system active, a claim about the configuration rather than the agent.
19. The notice is plain text. The harness renders `systemMessage` literally, so markup reaches the engineer as punctuation.
20. The notice carries no mark of its own. The startup display, which holds it, leads the same message, taken from `startup-display.sh message` (see the the-startup-display-prints-as-the-session-starts rule).
21. Put no quotation marks, and no lone backslash, in anything the hook emits.
22. `printf` interpolates the notice and the instruction into a JSON string with no escaping.
23. A double quote ends the string, and a lone backslash begins an invalid escape.
24. Either way the harness fails to parse the output, and the notice disappears with no error.
25. After a compaction, one line stands in place of the startup display and the notice: `Context compacted. Slasher is reloading its rules.` It says what the session does next, and reports no read.

## The read instruction

1. The same hook carries the read instruction to the agent on a separate channel.
2. The notice goes in `systemMessage`, for the engineer.
3. The instruction goes in `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`, which reaches the agent and is never displayed.
4. They are different texts for different readers.
5. The read is unconditional. The apparent size of the first request is not a reason to defer it.
6. A session opened with a one-line request once skipped the read. It grew into rule edits and publishes governed by rules never read.
7. The hook carries the whole instruction, as the following points state.
8. The instruction tells the agent to run `foundation/load-rules.sh` in one command and read its whole output. The loader's output is the read, so no rule file is read one by one.
9. The loader prints each package's `rules-pre-loaded.md` and `vocabulary.md`, `foundation/` first, then the local rules, the project's vocabulary, and the journal. It leaves out each package's `source/` and `README.md`.
10. Its ON DEMAND section lists the rules it does not print, each with its trigger and the command that loads it. When the trigger's act comes up, the agent runs that command and follows the rule before acting.
11. Name `local/rules/` and `local/vocabulary.md` whether or not each exists, and say that the absence of either is ordinary, not an error. Never name `local/` as a whole.
12. Name the other working directories, as not read as binding rules at session start.
13. Do not print the startup display.
14. Print no package count.
15. Then wait for the engineer's request.
16. After a compaction, the instruction opens by saying the rules now survive only as the compaction's summary, and that the loader is to be run again before the next act. The hook reads the event's source from its input. A start, a resume, and a clear get the instruction unchanged.
17. The instruction carries the core rules after it, the rules `foundation/core-rules` names, each as the loader prints it, under a line saying they hold before the read, which still runs in full. The core holds only the rules that shape the first answer, so the whole of what the hook gives the agent stays within 10,000 characters, the most a hook can give. The hook escapes their quotation marks and backslashes.
18. `load rules` asks for exactly that read and nothing more. The startup display's load line names `/load`, and the instruction names both. `/load`, its skill, typed `/load` or `/slasher:load`, is the same command. It follows the instruction `session-start.sh instruction` prints, the one text both follow.
19. This rule does not restate the directory list.
20. `session-start.sh` is the only place the list is enumerated, since a second copy drifted once.
21. The mark's art is not carried on this channel, and is not written into this hook's script. `startup-display.sh` reads it from the the-startup-display-prints-as-the-session-starts rule and escapes it.
22. Nothing verifies the read. The hook cannot observe what the agent does.
23. The instruction removes one excuse: an instruction buried in a file the agent may not open.
24. Instructing is not vouching: the notice still reports nothing about whether the agent read the rules.
25. The work honoring the rules is the verification.

## The status line

1. `slasher/system/foundation/statusline.sh` keeps the system's presence on screen all session:

```
slasher · master :: Slasher
slasher · master · uncommitted changes · untracked files · unpushed commits :: Slasher
```

2. The repository name leads, in bold. The bold is a terminal escape sequence the harness passes through.
3. The bold repository name is the only emphasis on the line.
4. A middle dot separates the engineer's segments.
5. The Slasher segment trails after a double colon, which separates and does nothing else. So the segment reads as an annotation on the line.
6. The Slasher segment is one word, with no package count.
7. Presence is read from disk, by the same README test the notice uses.
8. The detail is the status report's (see the a-status-report-prints-a-fixed-whole-project-report rule).
9. `uncommitted changes` appears only when there is a modified tracked file, a staged change, or an untracked file that is not ignored.
10. It is words, not a mark like `master*`.
11. `untracked files` names the case whose remedy differs: add or ignore, not commit.
12. An untracked file raises both segments, deliberately, so `uncommitted changes` alone answers whether anything is uncommitted.
13. Segments that can show together are named in words that read distinctly.
14. `unpushed commits` appears when committed work exists only in this working copy. It carries no count and never reaches the network.
15. It compares against the remote-tracking ref, so it reflects the last fetch.
16. A branch with no upstream reports nothing, since unpushed is relative to an upstream.
17. An upstream missing by accident is a different fact, and is deliberately not folded into this segment.
18. Where a feature or an experiment is Open, Active, or Suspended, a second line shows its branch, or the branch of its phase under way, as `feature/receipt.tax-line`. `slasher/system/foundation/current-implementation.sh` finds it, in this repository's arrangement or an installed project's.
19. A phase is under way where its branch exists, and its commits count as work on its implementation. Where more than one implementation is current, show the one whose branch, or a phase's branch, has the latest commit.
20. Where none is current, print no second line.

## The startup display

1. As the session starts, the display's session-start part frames the notice's message: the title and the copyright and license ahead of it, and the load line after it, last, read from the the-startup-display-prints-as-the-session-starts rule.
2. On every prompt, the plugin's `UserPromptSubmit` hook runs `slasher/system/foundation/startup-display.sh`, which prints the loading part, the loading line and then the figure, on the session's first prompt only.
3. The first prompt is when the read starts, whatever the prompt is.
4. The agent does not print it.

## Wiring

1. The committed Slasher plugin, `.claude/skills/slasher/`, wires the notice and the display through its `SessionStart` and `UserPromptSubmit` hooks.
2. A committed `.claude/settings.json` wires the status line, since a plugin cannot set the main status line.
3. `install.sh` assembles the plugin and places `.claude/settings.json` in a consuming project.
4. `install.sh` warns when git ignores `.claude/settings.json` or the plugin and the file is not tracked, and prints how to correct it.
5. The fix is `.claude/*` with `!.claude/settings.json` and `!.claude/skills/`, since git cannot re-include a file inside an excluded directory.
6. The fix keeps `.claude/settings.local.json` ignored.
7. A project-level `statusLine` replaces the engineer's own, so the script renders the directory and branch too.
8. `install.sh` never merges into an existing `.claude/settings.json`. It prints the block, or the hook entries to remove where the file still runs the session-start scripts, and leaves the decision to the engineer.

## There is no opt-out

1. These surfaces exist so that a system read every session says so.
2. The read instruction is emitted every session. Quieting a display never disables the mechanism that carries it.
3. Add no opt-out, such as a variable that quiets these surfaces.

## What this costs

1. The mechanism works only where a harness loads a plugin from `.claude/skills/` and reads `.claude/settings.json`.
2. Elsewhere the system loads through the `AGENTS.md` bootstrap, silently.
3. A setting that disables hooks silences it too.
4. A newly placed plugin or `.claude/settings.json` may not take effect until the harness reloads.

# The implementations directory holds one record per implementation

Source: system/foundation/source/the-implementations-directory-holds-one-record-per-implementation.md

Trigger: When starting an experiment or feature, or writing or changing an implementation record

1. `slasher/local/implementations/` holds implementation records, one file per implementation.
2. A record carries how the implementation began, where it is being worked, and what became of it.
3. An implementation is a bounded unit of work with a lifecycle.
4. The record is a persisted, dated artifact, kept after the implementation concludes.
5. An experiment is tagged `[experiment]`, and a feature is tagged `[feature]`. These are ordinary square-bracket tags (see the a-record-may-be-categorized-with-square-bracket-tags rule).
6. The tags name what the work is. No rule reads them to decide how the work runs.
7. Either kind opens with a question or an intent, whichever the work has.
8. Whether the work states a forecast is asked at the start. Put it to the engineer, and record it as a confirmation beside the working location and the participation.
9. Whether the work reaches a verdict is asked at the end, of work with a forecast only, and recorded as a confirmation. The lifecycle reads both. Neither follows from the kind, or from whether the work opens with a question or an intent.

## The record

1. Open with the **Question** or the **Intent**.
2. Then give the setup: a `**State:**` line, the upstream branch it merges into, the implementation branch, its base, the working location chosen at the start, and whether it states a forecast. Add whether it reaches a verdict at the end.
3. The upstream branch is `master` or another topic branch.
4. The setup also includes a `**Tags:**` line carrying `[experiment]` or `[feature]`.
5. Work with a forecast states it, what is expected to happen, before the work.
6. As the work proceeds, it records what actually happened against the forecast.
7. It then records the findings and any post-hoc misses, including outcomes the forecast did not account for.
8. Work without a forecast records no comparison against one, and no findings or misses. It concludes Completed, unless the engineer concludes it with a verdict word.
9. Every record carries the confirmations the lifecycle required, so the work's authority is auditable.
10. Every record carries these: the working-location selection, the attended-or-unattended selection, and the forecast selection, each at the start, and the verdict selection at the end where the work has a forecast.
11. Every record also carries these: adding a worktree to work already under way, and branch deletion with worktree removal.
12. Work that reaches a verdict also records the affirmation declaration, concluding a superseded implementation, and merging untested code.

## The state

1. The state sits on a canonical `**State:**` line carrying one word and nothing else, for example `- **State:** Suspended`.
2. Write the line with the record, as `Open`, and change it as the record reaches another word.
3. That line is the only authoritative statement of the state.
4. The state words may appear freely in the record's prose. Nothing else in the file is read as the state.
5. `Active` is the in-progress state, as it is for an item.
6. A record without a line is a defect. Absence is not a state.
7. Do not invent a state word.
8. `new` creates the branch and writes the record `Open`. `start` makes it `Active`.
9. The filename carries the state suffix, as `-OPEN` or `-ACTIVE` (see the a-record-carrying-a-state-line-ends-its-filename-with-the-state-in-upper-case rule).
10. The state words every implementation takes are these.
    - **Open**: the record and the branch exist, and the work has not started.
    - **Active**: the work is in progress.
    - **Deferred**: kept to do later, with no one working toward it.
    - **Suspended**: paused, not ended.
    - **Discontinued**: stopped, with no plan to do it. It is not current work: the list of current work and the session-start notice leave it out. What it recorded may be merged.
    - **Obsolete**: it lost its relevance over time, with no one deciding.
    - **Superseded**: replaced by another implementation. Each of the two records names its counterpart. Supersede at any time, without suspending first.
    - **Abandoned**: dropped before concluding, by decision. It is not merged, and the record is kept.
11. The concluding words are these, and any implementation takes any of them, whether or not it has a forecast.
    - **Completed**: integrated into the upstream branch. It is the ordinary conclusion.
    - **Affirmed**: the question held, or the intent was met, as forecast where there is one. The engineer declares it.
    - **Refuted**: the question was disproven, or the intent was not met.
    - **Inconclusive**: it ran and gave no clear verdict either way.
12. The engineer concludes an implementation Affirmed, Refuted, or Inconclusive with `affirm`, `refute`, or `inconclusive`. `complete` concludes work without a forecast as Completed. Where the work has a forecast, ask which concluding word it takes.
13. Where the implementation is created for an item, make the item Implementation, and name each record in the other. When the implementation is Completed or Affirmed, conclude the item in its kind's concluding state. Otherwise, at its conclusion or when it is set aside, ask the engineer what state the item takes.
14. `resume` takes back any state but Open and Active, to Active. What resuming a Completed implementation does to its merged branch is settled when it first occurs.
15. Where the engineer asks for an implementation to be concluded and names no state, put the concluding states it can take to the engineer through the selection interface. Do not choose the state, and do not conclude the implementation before the engineer selects one. *Conclude the feature* names no state. *The feature is completed* names one.

## Runs

1. Runs are optional.
2. Only work that reaches a verdict has runs.
3. Split an implementation into runs only when its question or intent is held fixed and one factor is varied to compare.
4. Each run is its own branch from the same base.
5. Each run carries its own forecast.
6. Runs are titled `Run 1`, `Run 2`, and so on.
7. A run is a deliberate variation, not a retry.

## It is the lifecycle record, not the design record

1. The same work's design belongs in a loop record under `slasher/local/logs/loops/`.
2. A loop record holds each cycle's hinge, the options put to the engineer, and the decision.
3. The implementation record and the loop record divide by concern. Each names the other.
4. Keep them as separate files. `slasher/local/logs/loops/` belongs to `design-by-efferent`, which includes `foundation`, not the reverse.
5. A foundation rule must not require fields in that directory. That dependency is refused.
6. Naming the loop record in prose is a citation and is permitted. It is the only reference permitted.

## Format

1. Use the same frontmatter-free markdown as rules: a title, then prose and tables.
2. The title is `# Experiment — <name>` or `# Feature — <name>`.
3. The kind reads in the title and is stated as data in the `**Tags:**` line.
4. A record whose title and tag name different kinds is defective.
5. The filename takes the ISO-8601-UTC prefix (see the file-names rule).
6. The filename also takes the state suffix.
7. End the file with the provenance footer.
8. Pair the record with a log entry (see the a-log-entry-is-written-for-an-implementation-record-and-the-concluding-entry-depends-on-whether-the-work-merged rule).

# The items directory holds one file per item

Source: system/foundation/source/the-items-directory-holds-one-file-per-item.md

Trigger: When creating an item, changing an item's state or content, or answering against what an item settled

1. `slasher/local/items/` holds the project's items, one file per item. Every record there is an item, and only an item.
2. An item is the thinking that settles what the work should be and how it should go.
3. Name the file with the ISO-8601-UTC prefix, ending in its state in upper case.
4. Write the item as frontmatter-free markdown.
5. Give it, in this order, a `# <title>`, a `**State:**` line, a `**Tags:**` line, and whatever the item has to say. A provenance footer ends it.
6. Write a log entry when the item is created and at each change of its state.
7. Put no code samples in an item.
8. Nothing else is required. Add no shape the thinking does not have.
9. Where an item records decisions, record them as dated **Settled** resolutions.
10. Where an item that settles things deliberately leaves something out, mark it in an **Out of Scope / Deferred** tail.
11. An item that sequences work carries checkbox tasks stating behavior.
12. An item that neither settles things nor sequences work carries neither resolutions nor tasks.
13. An item may carry tags, such as `[design]`, `[plan]`, or `[aspiration]`.
14. Tag an item that has no tag at all `[idea]`.
15. Give `[idea]` to no item that already carries a tag.
16. Assign no tag but `[idea]` by default. Write `[aspiration]` only where an aspiration was asked for.
17. The tag set is open.
18. An item may carry several tags.
19. Tags are the ordinary square-bracket tags every working-state artifact takes (see the a-record-may-be-categorized-with-square-bracket-tags rule).
20. `[note]` and `[work]` mean what their rules say: the notes rule, and the work-item section below.
21. Create an item as a kind by tagging it with the kind's name. A kind needs no description beyond its name. A kind this rule does not list is as good as one it does. An item created with no kind is tagged `[idea]`.
22. `[idea]` is a thought proposed and not yet settled. An idea proposes something new. `[improvement]` is a proposed change to something that already exists, not yet settled, and concludes Realized when the change exists. `[correction]` is a proposed change that puts right something that exists and is wrong. It carries `[correction]`, `[work]`, and `[rework]` together, and concludes `Corrected` when the fix exists. An improvement changes something that is not wrong. `[rework]` is work to redo something already produced that turned out wrong, and carries `[rework]`, `[work]`, and `[correction]` together. Of the two, the first tag names which was asked for. `[design]` is settled direction, as dated Settled resolutions. `[plan]` is a sequence of work, as checkbox tasks stating behavior, with no code.
23. `[aspiration]` is an outcome hoped for, written only where one was asked for. `[goal]` is an outcome the project means to reach, which other items serve, open until reached or given up.
24. `[problem]` is something wrong or in the way, recorded without a solution named. `[mistake]` is an act that should have gone otherwise, recorded with what went wrong and why.
25. A kind takes the states every item takes, except where its own rule says otherwise.
26. An item may carry two optional lines, `**Waits for:**` and `**Priority:**`, and most items carry neither.
27. `**Waits for:**` states what must finish before the item is actionable, and nothing more.
28. `**Priority:** N`, written as `- **Priority:** 3`, ranks the item from 1 to N, contiguous, one item to a number.
29. Rank 1 is worked next among the actionable items.
30. Ranking an item renumbers those below it. The several files that changes are the accepted cost.
31. A waiting item may still be ranked, and a rank does not clear a wait.
32. Nothing derives from either line.
33. An item's content is point-in-time.
34. A reference in an item that time has overtaken is not a defect.
35. Do not chase such a reference.
36. Every item carries a `**State:**` line from the moment it is written, holding one of the words below and no other. Absence is not a state, and an item without the line is a defect.
37. Start an idea, an improvement, a plan, a work item, a rework item, a correction, a mistake, and a problem **Open**. **Open** means the work has not started, whether its thinking is settled or not. A kind not named here starts Open and concludes Realized.
38. Make an item **Active** when its work starts. **Active** is the in-progress state.
39. Start a goal, an aspiration, a design, and a note **Recorded**. A design and a note stay Recorded. Make a goal or an aspiration Active from Recorded where the engineer asks, or leave it Recorded.
40. **Realized** — what it describes exists. An idea, an improvement, a plan, a goal, and an aspiration conclude Realized. A goal or an aspiration is Realized only when the engineer says so.
41. **Deferred** — kept to do later, with no date and no one working toward it.
42. An item merely waiting its turn is not **Deferred**. It carries `**Waits for:**` and whatever state its thinking has reached.
43. **Suspended** — paused, not ended.
44. **Superseded** — a later item replaced it, and the two name each other.
45. **Abandoned** — dropped by decision.
46. **Obsolete** — it lost its relevance over time, as the work moved past it with no one deciding. Where a decision dropped it, it is **Abandoned**. Any item that changes state takes it.
47. **Discontinued** — stopped, with no plan to do it. It is not current work, so the list of current items leaves it out. Deferred is kept to do later, and Discontinued has no plan to do it.
48. Take back any state but Open, Active, and Recorded with resume, to Open or Active as the engineer's words say. Where they do not say which, ask. Conclude an item whose work is done on an experiment's branch when the work is done, in its kind's concluding state. Do not wait for the merge, and name the branch.
49. At each change of state, change the `**State:**` line and rename the file.
50. At each change of state, write the log entry.
51. An item tagged `[work]` is a piece of work to be done.
52. **Corrected** — what was wrong is put right. A correction and a mistake conclude Corrected. **Resolved** — the problem no longer stands. A problem concludes Resolved. **Completed** — items take it, and no kind concludes with it yet.
53. A work item and a rework item conclude `Done`. Every item that changes state takes Deferred, Suspended, Discontinued, Obsolete, Superseded, and Abandoned.
54. A work item never takes `Realized`. Where an item carries two kind tags: `[idea]` with `[design]` concludes as an idea, and a correction or a rework item concludes as its first tag says.
55. Complete concludes an item in its kind's concluding state.
56. Supersede an item rather than rewrite it.
57. What a superseded item settled stays as written.
58. Amend an item by dated addition.
59. When amending, keep an outdated resolution's date and wording, and state what changed in a later resolution.
60. Answer a question that runs against what an item settled, and record the change.
61. Do not refuse to answer until the item is amended.
62. Where one item names another as what it realizes, the named item is the source of truth. Reconcile it; never regenerate it from the work downstream.
63. Where the engineer asks for an item to be concluded and names no state, put the concluding states the item can take to the engineer through the selection interface. Do not choose the state, and do not conclude the item before the engineer selects one. *Conclude that item* names no state. *That item is done* names one. The implementations rule asks the same for an implementation concluded with no state named. *Complete that item* names its kind's concluding state.
64. **Implementation** — when a feature or an experiment is created for an item, the item takes Implementation, and the two records name each other. It is not a current item, since the implementation is listed as current work in its place.
65. When the implementation is Completed or Affirmed, the item takes its kind's concluding state. When it reaches another concluding state, or is set aside, ask the engineer what state the item takes.

# The log records why work was abandoned, and never says undone work was done

Source: system/foundation/source/the-log-records-why-work-was-abandoned-and-never-says-undone-work-was-done.md

Trigger: When writing a log entry, especially one recording abandoned work

1. A log entry never conveys that something was done when it was not done.
2. This prohibition holds whatever the entry is about.
3. The log on `master` never conveys that work from an abandoned branch landed on `master`.

## What an abandonment entry carries

1. When work is abandoned, write the entry as the decision to stop and the reasoning given for it.
2. Where no reason was given, the entry says so.
3. Write no reason that was not given. An agent's reading of why the engineer stopped is not the engineer's reason.
4. Say plainly that nothing merged.
5. Say plainly where the work was.
6. Do not carry the unfinished work: not the unexecuted plan, the unrun increments, or the unbuilt design.
7. Where an entry needs more than a line, it takes a body, as the the-log-holds-one-file-per-entry-with-a-one-line-title rule describes.

## Why the mood is not enough

1. Careful tense is necessary but not sufficient.
2. An entry written entirely in conditional mood, such as *It would have taken the package to `ext/`*, still must not record unexecuted planning.
3. The test is the entry's subject, not its grammar.
4. Reasoning for stopping belongs in the log. Work that stopped does not.

1. `slasher/local/logs/` holds the project's contemporaneous, historical records, together. Every record here takes the ISO-8601-UTC prefix of the file-names rule.
2. `slasher/local/logs/log/` holds the log, one file per entry, with a one-line title (`the-log-holds-one-file-per-entry-with-a-one-line-title`).
3. `slasher/local/logs/loops/` holds the loop records, one file per feature, recording the cycles through the loop (`design-by-efferent`'s a-loop-record-holds-the-cycles-through-the-loop-one-file-per-feature rule).
4. `slasher/local/logs/work-sessions/` holds the narrative record of a work session (`the-work-sessions-directory-holds-one-record-per-work-session`).
5. Write a decision entry to `slasher/local/logs/log/`.
6. Write a loop record to `slasher/local/logs/loops/`.
7. Write a work session record to `slasher/local/logs/work-sessions/`.
8. A record belongs here only when it accrues chronologically and is never revised.
9. Each record here is a running account, entry after entry, in the order things happened, and it is reached by date.
10. Nothing here states what is currently true. Items, implementation records, and migration records do not belong here.
11. A migration record does not belong here. It is one document, revised while the migration runs, and prospective: steps written to be executed.
12. Keeping a record afterward makes it durable, not chronological. Durability does not qualify a record for this directory.
13. The three records keep their own names and their own conventions. This rule only groups them.
14. `log` stays `log`. Do not rename it to `decisions`, because every rule that says *write a log entry* means that directory.

## A fourth contemporaneous, historical record goes here

1. Put a contemporaneous, historical record this rule does not name under `slasher/local/logs/` too.
2. The convention that adds it names its directory under `slasher/local/logs/`.
3. That is all this rule asks of a later convention.

## The grouping crosses a package boundary, and does not invert it

1. `logs/loops/` is contributed by `design-by-efferent`, which includes `foundation`, not the reverse.
2. Foundation's naming of `logs/loops/` is only a citation.
3. Foundation requires nothing of what sits inside `loops/`, reads nothing there, and derives nothing from it.
4. A project that installs only `foundation` has `logs/log/` and no `logs/loops/`, and nothing is missing.

# The recent report says what was recently done, and what is next

Source: system/foundation/source/the-recent-report-says-what-was-recently-done-and-what-is-next.md

Trigger: When the engineer types `/recent`, or asks what was recently done and what is next

1. `/recent` says in a few lines what was recently done and what is next.
2. What was recently done is read from the latest log entries and commits: a short list, newest last, each a fact about the work. It covers the branch the work is on, and `master` where work landed there too.
3. Say how many commits on each branch are not yet pushed.
4. What is next is the next step of the work under way, found as `/next?` finds it. Where more than one piece of work is under way, name the next step of each, the one the conversation is on first.
5. Carry no task table, no map of `slasher/`, and no suite run. Those belong to `/status-report`.
6. Read the log, the commits, and the records when the command is typed, never from memory. A record the status report rule hides is counted rather than listed.
7. Head the part that gives the next step *What's next*, not *What is next*.
8. Number the list of what was recently done from 1, not with bullets. Give the part that gives the next step bullets, not numbers.

# The Slasher skills are delivered as a plugin named slasher

Source: system/foundation/source/the-slasher-skills-are-delivered-as-a-plugin-named-slasher.md

Trigger: When writing a Slasher skill, or installing, refreshing, or activating the packages that carry skills

1. The skills reach a project as one skills-directory plugin, called Slasher, at `.claude/skills/slasher/`, whose `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` gives `name` as `slasher`, the namespace, and `displayName` as `Slasher`, the name shown. A skill is typed `/slasher:<command>`, as in `/slasher:log`, or `/<command>` where no other command claims the name.
2. Each package carries its own skills, as `skills/<command>/SKILL.md`, one directory per root command or alias. A skill belongs to the package whose rule it hands its act to. A command whose name cannot be a directory's, as `/.`, or whose directory would show as the same name as another's, as `/'` beside `/?`, takes a directory named for it in words, such as `dot` or `apostrophe`, and gives the command in the skill's `name` field.
3. `assemble-plugin.sh` builds `.claude/skills/slasher/` from foundation's `plugin/` directory, which holds the manifest and the hooks, and the active packages' skills, leaving out a deactivated package's. `install.sh` and `refresh-packages.sh` run it, and `compile.sh` in the Slasher authoring source.
4. Commit the assembled directory, as `.claude/settings.json` is committed. Change a skill in its package, never in the assembled directory.
5. A skill's body stays thin: it only reads the words typed, loads the rule governing the act with `load-rules.sh`, and follows it. Where a script already prints the instruction the act follows, the skill runs it and follows its output instead, as `/load` runs `session-start.sh instruction`.
6. Each command domain's help command carries the domain's help, as `help.md` beside its `SKILL.md`: that domain's section of the help text. `/<command> help` prints it. A skill that is not its domain's help command carries no `help.md`.
7. `/slasher help` prints every active domain's help together, in the order of the help text. A bare `/slasher` offers topics to learn about.
8. A domain with no root command of its own name, such as PROCESS or LANGUAGE, has a skill that takes only `help`, as `/process` and `/language`.

# The startup display prints as the session starts

Source: system/foundation/source/the-startup-display-prints-as-the-session-starts.md

Trigger: When a session starts, or the engineer types its first prompt, or when changing the startup display or its script

1. The display prints verbatim in two parts. The session-start part prints as the session starts: the title and the copyright and license ahead of the session-start notice, and the load line after it, last. The loading part, the loading line and then the figure, prints on the session's first prompt, whatever it is. These five are always printed, in this file's order.
2. The package set is printed only where the project has declared one, after the loading part.
3. The harness prints both parts. The agent prints none of them.
4. As the session starts, the Slasher plugin's `SessionStart` hook runs `slasher/system/foundation/session-start.sh`, which prints the title and the copyright and license ahead of the session-start notice and the load line after it, in one `systemMessage`. It takes them from `startup-display.sh message` and `startup-display.sh load-line`, each of which prints its blocks alone.
5. On every prompt, the plugin's `UserPromptSubmit` hook runs `slasher/system/foundation/startup-display.sh`, which prints the loading part as a `systemMessage` on the session's first prompt only. A marker named for the session, under the temporary directory, records that the first prompt has passed. A prompt that names no session prints the loading part every time.
6. The agent prints the package set, at the head of the response that carries the rule read.
7. The script reads the five from the fenced blocks of this rule's body, in its source file, by position. It stops at the `## Compressed` heading.
8. The first, third, and fourth fenced blocks are the title, the copyright and license, and the load line. The fifth and sixth are the loading line and the figure.
9. The second fenced block is the package-set example, which the script skips.
10. Adding, removing, or reordering a fenced block in this rule's body changes what is printed, so the rule's sections stay where they are.
11. The automated test `test/automated/startup-display.sh` compares the printed display with the expected text. It fails when the two differ.
12. The fences mark where each printed part begins and ends. They are not printed.
13. First the title, with the tagline under it:

```
Slasher: Human in the Loop Harness

The engineer decides. The agent generates. Humanity rules.
```

14. The title leads. It is the first line of the display, and nothing the agent writes stands ahead of it.
15. Each part opens with a line break, so its first line starts a line of its own after the harness's label, as in `SessionStart:startup says:`. Each part opens with one more, so a blank line stands between the label and the part's first line: the title, or the loading line. The breaks are the script's, not fenced blocks in this file.
16. The tagline stands under the title, as the root `README.md` gives it. No other subtitle or description is printed under it.
17. The title is the category line. The root `README.md` leads with the same line.
18. No description of Slasher is printed, beyond the tagline. What Slasher is and does belongs to the `README.md`.
19. The display carries nothing that argues for the system to a reader already using it.
20. The package set is described here, and prints after the display, where one is declared. The agent prints it after the harness has printed the display.
21. The stanza follows the display rather than sitting inside it.
22. Where no set is declared, this part is absent entirely. No line says there is none.
23. The declared set `default` prints nothing where nothing is deactivated.
24. The `default` set prints where it leaves an installed package deactivated, such as `ext/ruby-lang`.
25. The condition is that nothing is off, not that the name is `default`.
26. A suppressed stanza must never be the reason a deactivated package goes unmentioned.
27. A named set other than `default` prints even where nothing is deactivated.
28. The declaration is supplied to the agent by the read instruction, before any file is opened. The a-project-declares-which-installed-packages-are-active rule says where the record lives and what it carries.
29. The stanza takes this form:

```
*design-by-efferent*, **foundation**, **git**, **journal**, **language**, *testing*,
*ext/ruby-lang*, **versioning**
package set: content
(5 active of 8 installed)
```

30. The stanza's lines carry no gap between them.
31. The package list leads. The set's name follows it, above the count. The count closes the stanza.
32. The set is named in the engineer's own wording, as in `package set: content`, not in a restatement of it.
33. Every installed package is listed, in the order the session-start notice lists them.
34. Active packages are bold. Deactivated packages are italic.
35. No package is omitted, and none is replaced by a count.
36. The count line states how many are active and the installed total, in the form `(N active of M installed)`.
37. No legend is printed.
38. Emphasis is available on the package set stanza and nowhere else in the display.
39. The harness display is plain text, where markup reaches the engineer as literal asterisks.
40. Then one blank line, then the copyright notice and the license line, on consecutive lines with no gap between them:

```
Copyright © 2026 Scott Bellware
*Eventide Common Interest License*
```

41. The copyright and license belong on this display, not on the session-start notice. Any standing statement that never changes belongs here, not as a permanent segment of the notice.
42. The copyright line carries the owner and the year alone. It does not name the work.
43. The license line is the license's name alone, set in italics. It takes no leading words such as *Licensed under the*.
44. The block keeps the license line in italics. `startup-display.sh` removes the asterisks from a line wrapped in them, so it prints without them.
45. The gap falls after the license line, never between it and the copyright.
46. The printed license line points to the license. It does not carry the terms, and is not the place to put them.
47. The `LICENSE` file states the terms. A copy sits at this repository's root and in every package directory.
48. The year is the year of the notice, not of the session. It is written into this rule and printed verbatim.
49. The year is not computed. It changes only when the rule changes.
50. The load line follows the session-start notice, after one blank line, and ends the session-start message:

```
Slasher's rules will load on the first prompt, or enter: /load
```

51. The load line states that the rules load on the first prompt, whatever it is, and that `/load` loads them now. It names its subject, *Slasher's rules*, itself. The plugin that prints it carries the `/load` skill, so the command it names is always available.
52. The session-start notice has no close of its own. The load line says what a close said.
53. The loading part opens with the loading line, which names the wait for the read:

```
Slasher is pre-loading its rules... this could take a minute
```

54. Then one blank line, then the block, which ends the loading part:

```
     __      /
    /  \    /
   |    |  /
    \__/  /
      | =/=
     _|_/
    / |
     / \
    /   \
   /    /
===========
    | |
  __|_|__
 (o)   (o)
```

55. Each gap is one blank line: after the title, after the license line, and ahead of the load line in the session-start part, and after the loading line in the loading part.
56. The harness renders the display as plain text, so the lines print exactly as the blocks hold them.
57. A blank line prints as a blank line. The figure keeps its spacing without a fence.
58. These are the whole of what is printed. No greeting, no account of what is about to be read, and no name for the block accompany them.
59. The package set's absence is the ordinary case, not an omission.
60. After a compaction, the session-start part is not printed. One line stands in its place, per the the-harness-announces-slashers-installation-and-the-agent-never-prints-the-notice rule.

# Unattended carries out a request without stopping for the engineer

Source: system/foundation/source/unattended-carries-out-a-request-without-stopping-for-the-engineer.md

Trigger: When the engineer types `/unattended`

1. `/unattended <request>` has the agent carry out the request on its own. With no request typed, ask for one through the free-text option.
2. Show a plan first, through the selection interface: *Accept the plan?*, the plan as its list, and the options *Accept* and *Revise*. On *Revise*, revise and show it again. Generate nothing until it is accepted.
3. After acceptance, decide every question yourself: candidates, design, wording, confirmations, and commits on any branch but `master`. Record each decision where its convention records it, as the agent's, with its reasoning.
4. A commit on `master` and a push still wait for the engineer's selection.
5. Where the request names a feature to build or an item to start, start an unattended feature for it, choosing its working location and whether it states a forecast, and recording them as the agent's selections. The verdict question at its end waits for the engineer. Otherwise work where the working tree is, creating no branch.
6. It holds for the one request. The next prompt is attended unless it also begins with `/unattended`.

# Working-state artifacts carry a provenance footer

Source: system/foundation/source/working-state-artifacts-carry-a-provenance-footer.md

Trigger: When creating or changing a working-state document under slasher/

1. Every working-state artifact under `slasher/` that is a document with a body ends with a **provenance footer**.
2. The footer is the `Authored by … / Changed by …` block, in the record-a-rules-authorship-in-a-provenance-footer format, with a local human-readable datetime.
3. The footer goes on every implementation record, whether an experiment or a feature.
4. It goes on every item, whatever it is tagged, including designs, plans, notes, and deferred work.
5. It goes on every loop record and every work session record.
6. Write `Authored by <name> on <local datetime>` for the original author, on creation.
7. Append a `Changed by <name> on <local datetime>` line for each later change, oldest first.
8. Never rewrite an existing footer line.
9. The datetime is the artifact's true authoring time.
10. For a dated artifact, its ISO-8601-UTC filename prefix is the authoritative creation time.
11. A later git add-date from a migration is a false trail. Do not use it as the authoring time.

## The one exception — the log

1. Do not add a footer to a `slasher/local/logs/log/` entry.
2. A log entry is deliberately one line: a `# <title>`, with no body and no template. See the the-log-holds-one-file-per-entry-with-a-one-line-title rule.
3. A log entry records who and when by its ISO-8601-UTC filename and its commit history, not by an in-file footer.
