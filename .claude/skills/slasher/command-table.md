| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/slasher help` | Print the help of every Slasher command |
| `/commands, /;` | Print this table |
| `/recent, /.` | Brief summary of recent work, and what's next. |
| `/current, /'` | Lists the current items, then the current features and experiments. |
| `/next, /proceed, /..` | Proceed to the next step in the current multi-step process or with the action that the agent is suggesting, or resume interrupted work |
| `/next?, /?` | "What are we doing?" or "what's next?" The next step in the current multi-step process, or the step that has been interrupted. |
| `/item` | Items hold the project's thinking: ideas, plans, designs, notes, and work to be done, each with a state. |
| `/feature` | A feature builds something the project needs, on its own branch or worktree, to a declared end. Features and experiments are both kinds of implementations. |
| `/features` | Lists the current features. |
| `/experiment` | An experiment tests a question on its own branch or worktree, to a declared end. Features and experiments are both kinds of implementations. |
| `/experiments` | Lists the current experiments. |
| `/process` | These commands move the work under way along: take its next step, or say what was done and what's next. |
| `/log` | The log records what was decided and when, and a work session record tells the story of a stretch of work. |
| `/decision` | Log a decision, tagged [decision] |
| `/note` | Record a note |
| `/journal` | The journal is the writer's own record of what they think, either stored with the project or kept in a private journal. |
| `/private` | Anything given to /private is recorded only in the private directory, outside the project's repository, and is read only on command. |
| `/brainstorm` | Brainstorming records points as they are said, freeform in no order, and organizes them when the writer is done. |
| `/test` | These commands run the project's tests, or other compliance routines, quality checks, and report on them. |
| `/push, /p` | Pushes the current branch to its remote, and never forces. |
| `/projects` | Lists the Slasher projects registered on this machine. The list helps move ideas, new patterns, and corrections into other projects. |
| `/release` | Presents the candidates for a package's next version, for the engineer to choose. |
| `/package` | These commands manage the installed packages: which are active, refreshing them, and installing Slasher. |
| `/language` | These commands work on language: reserving a word, ETE, Slasher's implementation of STE and its extensions, and clarifying language, often the agent's. |
| `/clarify, /??` | Explain the previous answer again using what the agent knows of the engineer's understanding |
| `/idk` | Say "I don't know" to the agent's last question, so it explains the question and asks it again |
| `/ask-again, /aa` | Repeat the agent's previous multiple-choice question |
| `/estimate-confidence, /%` | The agent's confidence of proceeding unattended from where the work stands |
| `/unattended, /#` | Carry out a request on the agent's own, after a plan is accepted |
| `/shortcuts, /sc` | Print the shortcuts table |
| `/load` | Loads the rules now, without waiting for the first prompt. |

Type /help for all of Slasher's help, or /<command> help for one command's.
