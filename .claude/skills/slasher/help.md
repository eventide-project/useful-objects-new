SLASHER SKILLS

Usage: /<command> [<subcommand>] [<arguments>]
       A command typed with no subcommand asks which one is meant,
       except where a bare command has its own meaning, shown below.
       A bare /slasher offers topics to learn about. /command-table prints
       the command domain table, one line for each command domain, and
       /commands and /; are aliases of /command-table. /shortcuts
       prints the shortcuts table, and /sc is an alias of /shortcuts.
       /slasher help prints this help, and /help is an alias of
       /slasher help.

ITEMS
  Items hold the project's thinking: ideas, plans, designs, notes, and work
  to be done, each with a state.

  /item new [<kind>]               Create an item tagged [<kind>], or [idea]
                                   with no kind. Any kind may be named.
  /item <kind>                     An alias of /item new <kind>, where the
                                   kind is not also a subcommand of /item
  /item idea, /idea                Create an item tagged [idea]
  /item improvement, /improvement  Create an item tagged [improvement]
  /item correction, /correction    Create an item tagged [correction] [work]
                                   [rework]
  /item rework, /rework            Create an item tagged [rework] [work]
                                   [correction]
  /item work, /work, /work-item    Create an item tagged [work]
  /item plan, /plan                Create an item tagged [plan]
  /item design, /design            Create an item tagged [design]
  /item aspiration, /aspiration    Create an item tagged [aspiration]
  /item goal, /goal                Create an item tagged [goal]
  /item note, /note                Record a note
  /item mistake, /mistake          Create an item tagged [mistake]
  /item problem, /problem          Create an item tagged [problem]
  /item list <state>, /list <state>
                                   List items in a state
                                   <state>: any item state, or "current"
                                   (Open and Active)

  /item start, /start              Open, or Recorded for a goal or an
                                   aspiration -> Active
  /item complete, /complete        -> the kind's concluding state:
                                   Realized, Done, Corrected, or Resolved
  /item realize, /realize          -> Realized
  /item done, /done                -> Done ([work] and [rework] items)
  /item defer, /defer              -> Deferred (kept to do later)
  /item suspend, /suspend          -> Suspended
  /item discontinue, /discontinue  -> Discontinued (no plan to do it)
  /item obsolete, /obsolete        -> Obsolete
  /item supersede, /supersede      -> Superseded, naming the replacement
  /item abandon, /abandon          -> Abandoned
  /item resume, /resume            Any state but Open, Active, or
                                   Recorded -> Open or Active

  Each state change also acts on a feature or an experiment, and
  asks which record is meant where the words do not say. A state
  the record cannot take is refused. /affirm, /refute, and
  /inconclusive act on a feature or an experiment only.

  /item help                       Print this command's help

  /note help                       Print this command's help

  A bare /idea is /idea new. A bare /note is /note new.
  A kind that is also a subcommand, such as list, is created with
  /item new list.

FEATURES
  A feature builds something the project needs, on its own branch or worktree,
  to a declared end. Features and experiments are both kinds of implementations.

  /feature new                     Create its branch and an Open record
  /feature new with phases         Create it, asking for its phases
  /feature status                  Phases, current phase, and its goal
  /feature start, /start           Open -> Active
  /feature complete, /complete     -> Completed, or asks which state
                                   where there is a forecast
  /feature affirm, /affirm         -> Affirmed (engineer's declaration only)
  /feature refute, /refute         -> Refuted
  /feature inconclusive, /inconclusive
                                   -> Inconclusive
  /feature defer, /defer           -> Deferred (kept to do later)
  /feature suspend, /suspend       -> Suspended
  /feature discontinue, /discontinue
                                   -> Discontinued (no plan to do it)
  /feature obsolete, /obsolete     -> Obsolete
  /feature supersede, /supersede   -> Superseded, naming the replacement
  /feature abandon, /abandon       -> Abandoned
  /feature resume, /resume         Any state but Open or Active -> Active
  /features [current] [<n>]        The current features, or the n most recent
  /feature help                    Print this command's help

  Either kind opens with a question or an intent. A forecast is
  stated at the start where you give one, and the verdict is asked
  when the work completes.

EXPERIMENTS
  An experiment tests a question on its own branch or worktree, to a declared
  end. Features and experiments are both kinds of implementations.

  /experiment new                  Create its branch and an Open record
  /experiment new with phases      Create it, asking for its phases
  /experiment status               Phases, current phase, and its goal
  /experiment start, /start        Open -> Active
  /experiment complete, /complete  -> Completed, or asks which state
                                   where there is a forecast
  /experiment affirm, /affirm      -> Affirmed (engineer's declaration only)
  /experiment refute, /refute      -> Refuted
  /experiment inconclusive, /inconclusive
                                   -> Inconclusive
  /experiment defer, /defer        -> Deferred (kept to do later)
  /experiment suspend, /suspend    -> Suspended
  /experiment discontinue, /discontinue
                                   -> Discontinued (no plan to do it)
  /experiment obsolete, /obsolete  -> Obsolete
  /experiment supersede, /supersede
                                   -> Superseded, naming the replacement
  /experiment abandon, /abandon    -> Abandoned
  /experiment resume, /resume      Any state but Open or Active -> Active
  /experiments [current] [<n>]     The current experiments, or the n most recent
  /experiment help                 Print this command's help

PHASE
  Phases split a feature or an experiment into steps, run one at a time, each on
  its own sub branch.

  /phase, /phase current           The current phase, its goal, and its branch
  /phase add <name>                Add a phase after the last
  /phase start                     Start the next phase
  /phase complete                  -> Completed, merged into the implementation
  /phase affirm                    -> Affirmed (engineer's declaration only)
  /phase refute                    -> Refuted (the phase's proposition is
                                   not realized)
  /phase inconclusive              -> Inconclusive

  Whether a phase states a forecast is asked when it is added.
  A phase with one is asked the verdict question when it completes.

  /phases                          List the phases, the current one emphasized

  /phase help                      Print this command's help

  These commands move the work under way along: take its next step, or say what
  was done and what's next.

                                   that the agent is suggesting, or resume
                                   interrupted work

                                   process, or the step that has been

                                   question. The agent explains it, gives
                                   its recommendation, and asks it again

  /estimate-confidence             The agent's confidence of proceeding

  /private session end             End the private session. After 4 minutes
                                   with no prompt, the agent asks whether

  /private help                    Print this command's help

  /brainstorm help                 Print this command's help

TESTS
  These commands run the project's tests, or other compliance routines,
  quality checks, and report on them.

LANGUAGE
  These commands work on language: reserving a word, ETE, Slasher's
  implementation of STE and its extensions, and clarifying language, often the
  agent's.

  /clarify                         Explain the previous answer again using
                                   what the agent knows of the engineer's
