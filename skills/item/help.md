  to be done, each with a state.

                                   kind is not also a subcommand of /item

                                   (Open and Active)

  /item start, /start              Open, or Recorded for a goal or an
                                   aspiration -> Active
  /item complete, /complete        -> the kind's concluding state:
                                   Realized, Done, Corrected, or Resolved
  /item realize, /realize          -> Realized
  /item done, /done                -> Done ([work] and [rework] items)

                                   Recorded -> Open or Active

  Each state change also acts on a feature or an experiment, and
  asks which record is meant where the words do not say. A state
  the record cannot take is refused. /affirm, /refute, and
  /inconclusive act on a feature or an experiment only.

  /item help                       Print this command's help

  /note help                       Print this command's help

  A bare /idea is /idea new. A bare /note is /note new.
  A kind that is also a subcommand, such as list, is created with
  /item new list.
